But despite the commodity’s volatility, gold has repeatedly set records in recent years.', 'Since March, investors have been increasing their holdings of gold, driven by concerns about the health ofthe economyandmarket volatility. Longer term, Goldman Sachs Research expects prices to be propelled by multi-year demand from central banks. Our analysts’ gold price prediction is for these two factors to push the metal to new record highs.', 'Goldman Sachs Research’s gold price prediction 2025', 'Even so, Thomas says gold is likely to break more records this year. Goldman Sachs Research predicts gold will rise to $3,700 a troy ounce by the end of 2025 (from $3,220 on May 15) as central banks buy many tonnes of the precious metal every month.', 'The commodity is also likely to climb as ETF investors increase their holdings in anticipation of interest rate cuts and amid growing recession concerns. In the event of a recession,Goldman Sachs Researchforecasts that gold could rise to as much as $3,880 a troy ounce.', 'Private investors might also turn to gold to diversify away from US assets, particularly if traditional equity portfolio hedges such as US Treasuries continue to underperform during equity drawdowns. While not the team’s base case forecast, Thomas says even a small rotation out of US assets into gold would have a big, positive impact on the gold price given the relative sizes of the markets. For example, global gold ETF holdings are worth only about 1% of outstanding US Treasuries and 0.5% of the S&P500 market cap.', '“While the key factor since 2022 used to be central bank buying alone, ETF investors are now joining the gold rally,” Thomas says. “As both compete for the same bullion, we are expecting gold prices to rise even further.”', 'This article is being provided for educational purposes only.

Whether you’re watching gold for short-term trading opportunities or longer-term investment, understanding the latest trends and projected gold prices can help shape your strategy.', 'By April 2025, the gold price had exceeded $3,000 per ounce, after rallying throughout 2024. This momentum was supported by falling real yields, expectations of interest-rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, and ongoing demand from central banks and investors seeking diversification.', 'The improved sentiment from the easing of trade tensions between the US and China put gold under pressure in May. However, as global market conditions shifted in June, with heightened concerns over the Middle East and broader market instability, gold is regaining its strength. Investor sentiment has turned more cautious, and fear-driven capital is returning to gold, reinforcing its status as a safe-haven asset.', ""But will gold continue to shine through the rest of 2025 and beyond? Here's what the latest forecasts, trends, and expert commentary reveal."", 'Several global forces are shaping gold price expectations in 2025. While some are longstanding, like the inverse relationship with the US dollar, others are more situational, such as evolving central bank policies and inflation stickiness.', 'One of the biggest drivers for projected gold prices in 2025 is monetary policy. After one of the fastest tightening cycles in history, central banks including the Fed and the European Central Bank have paused or signalled the possibility of easing. Falling interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold, often fuelling higher prices.', 'As of April, markets were pricing in up to three rate cuts from the Fed by the end of the year. However, after the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady in June the general expectation switched to two potential cuts for the year. If inflation remains contained and economic data continues to weaken, many believe gold could see further upside – although past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.', 'From continued instability in the Middle East to tensions surrounding elections in major economies, geopolitical stress has played a major role in gold’s appeal as a risk hedge. At the same time, central bank purchases remain strong, with countries like China and India continuing to diversify reserves amid shifting global alliances.', 'Meanwhile, retail demand in Asia, particularly for jewellery, has remained resilient, even as Western investment flows have been more sensitive to yield and macro data.', 'Gold often moves inversely to the US dollar. When the greenback weakens, gold typically becomes cheaper for foreign investors and can rally as a result. In 2025, the dollar has softened slightly from its 2022 and 2023 peaks, helped by rate cut speculation and relative strength in other global currencies.', 'If the dollar continues to slide, it could bolster the gold value forecast over the coming months, particularly if real yields also decline.', 'Create an accountOpen a demo account', 'The 2025 gold price forecast has adapted as the precious metal traded above $3,000 per ounce. Attention has turned to how long this rally can last – and whether prices will continue climbing or face consolidation. Gold price forecasts help outline the potential trajectory of the precious metal over the short and medium term. While no forecast is certain, analysing projected gold prices from leading institutions offers insight into what investors and traders might expect in the months and years ahead.', 'Explorelive gold pricesor read ourgold trading guidefor more information on the gold market.', 'Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.', 'The 2025 breakout above $3,000/oz has prompted several analysts to revise their short-term gold value projections upward. Many forecasts now hinge on the pace of interest rate cuts, global growth uncertainty, and sustained demand from central banks.', 'In June,Citilowered its gold price targets, cutting the 0-3 month forecast from $3,500 to $3,300 per ounce and the 6-12 month target from $3,000 to $2,800. The bank cited declining investment demand and a potentially improving global growth outlook.', 'However,UBSprojected in April that gold would remain well supported, with a base-case target of $3,500/oz amid ongoing tariff and geopolitical uncertainties.', 'In May,Goldman Sachsalso saw potential upside for the precious metal, updating its gold forecast to$3,700by the end of year, from a range of around$3,100-$3,300, as similar concerns arose over geopolitical issues and US economic health.', 'JPMorganrevealed in June that it expected gold to average $3,675/oz by Q4 2025, citing the probability of recession and ongoing trade and tariff risks as conducive to general risk-off sentiment.', 'Some analysts caution that short-term corrections are possible, particularly if inflation surprises to the upside or if central banks pause their expected easing cycle. However, most agree that the $3,000 level has now become a key psychological and technical support area.', 'Longer-term gold projections for 2027-2030 are less common, but the gold price future still could be elevated relative to pre-2020 levels. Continued central bank diversification, fiscal fragility in key economies, and persistent geopolitical risk are seen as structural supports.', 'InvestingHaven, an independent financial research and forecasting site, sees a potential maximum gold price of $4,400 in 2027, with the peak price hitting an estimated $5,155 by 2030.', 'Swiss bankDukascopyprojects a potential average price of $2,500 in 2027, rising to $2,650 in 2028 and $2,950 by 2030.', 'LBMA’s Head of Multi Asset Charlie Morris believes gold could hit $7,000 by 2030, against a backdrop of raised inflation.', 'As with all long-range forecasts, these projections are subject to change based on evolving economic, monetary, and geopolitical conditions. Unexpected shocks such as fiscal stress in developed markets or further de-dollarisation trends could fuel even higher prices.', 'Gold’s position above $3,000 per ounce in 2025 reflects more than momentary volatility – it marks a period of deep structural demand across sectors and geographies.', 'Louise Street, Senior Analyst at theWorld Gold Council, expects central banks to continue driving demand in 2025, while ETF investors could step up their exposure in response to lower, but volatile, interest rates. ‘With geopolitical tensions, election-year uncertainty, and shifting monetary policy, we believe gold will remain in demand as a store of wealth and hedge against risk,’ she noted.', 'Elsewhere,MKS PAMP’s Nicky Shiels points out that gold is increasingly being viewed as a strategic portfolio allocation, not just a short-term hedge.', 'Meanwhile, HSBC analysts point to continued strength in Asian demand. Physical premiums in India and China remain elevated, suggesting resilience among retail buyers despite high spot prices.', 'It’s important to note that all forecasts represent the views of the institutions cited at the time of publication and are subject to change. They do not guarantee future performance and should not be relied upon as investment advice. Traders should consider their own objectives and risk tolerance before making decisions.', 'Gold has reasserted its role as a key asset in times of uncertainty, rising strongly in early 2025 thanks to dovish central bank signals, geopolitical stress, and robust demand. The gold market forecast for the rest of the year will likely hinge on whether those trends persist, or if inflationary and macro surprises throw a wrench into expectations.', 'Short-term price action may remain volatile, but many analysts maintain a broadly constructive view for the year ahead. Whether gold breaks new highs or consolidates recent gains, it remains a core focus for traders and investors alike.', 'Looking to trade commodities or diversify your portfolio? Discover opportunities in thecommodities marketsor learn more aboutcommodity trading strategies.', 'Analyst forecasts vary, but many now expect gold to remain in the $3,500-$3,700 range through the end of 2025. The actual price will depend on how key drivers – such as central bank policies, inflation, and geopolitical risk – play out over the coming months.', 'Many forecasts remain bullish, with expectations that gold will stay elevated or move slightly higher if rate cuts continue and uncertainty persists. However, prices could dip if inflation flares up again or if central banks delay easing.', 'Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation. When inflation rises and real interest rates fall, gold becomes more attractive to investors. Conversely, when inflation is under control and rates are high, gold can come under pressure.', 'You can follow real-time gold prices on ourgold spot commodity page, or exploreall commodity markets.', 'Over time, gold prices are shaped by a combination of macroeconomic trends, central bank demand, investor sentiment, and currency movements.

We remain deeply convinced of a continued structural bull case for gold and raise our price targets accordingly,” Kaneva added.', 'J.P.\xa0Morgan Research now expects prices to average $3,675/oz by the final quarter of 2025, rising toward $4,000/oz by the second quarter of 2026.', 'Gold prices are expected to average $3,675/oz by the fourth quarter of 2025.', 'The precious metal surpassed multiple record peaks in 2024 and broke through the $2,900/oz barrier for the first time in February this year, as investors navigated market volatility following U.S. tariffs and heightened geopolitical risks. Prices peaked at $3,500/oz in April against a backdrop of unpredictable U.S. trade policy.', 'Traditionally, a weaker U.S. dollar and lower U.S. interest rates increase the appeal of non-yielding bullion. Economic and geopolitical uncertainty also tend to be positive drivers for gold, due to its safe-haven status and ability to remain a reliable store of value. It has low correlation with other asset classes, so can act as insurance during falling markets and times of geopolitical stress.', 'But given gold’s diverse and fluid drivers of demand at the moment, the metal has recently served both as a debasement hedge — or a form of protection against the loss of a currency’s purchasing power due to inflation or currency debasement — and in its more traditional role as a non-yielding competitor to U.S. Treasuries and money market funds.', '“We still think risks are skewed toward an earlier overshoot of our forecasts if demand continues to surprise our expectations. For investors,\xa0we think gold remains one of the most optimal hedges for the unique combination of stagflation, recession, debasement and U.S. policy risks facing markets in 2025 and 2026,” said Gregory Shearer, head of Base and Precious Metals Strategy at J.P.\xa0Morgan.', 'Following gold’s significant 30% rally, some investors have questioned who the major buyers of gold will be in 2025, with prices at current levels.', 'Underpinning the J.P.\xa0Morgan Research forecast for gold prices is continued strong investor and central bank (CB) gold demand, which is projected to average around 710 tonnes a quarter on net this year.', 'Central banks:', 'Consistently high levels of purchases by CBs (900 tonnes forecasted in 2025) are expected, given the current macro environment as well as a further expansion in investor holdings, particularly fromexchange-traded funds(ETFs) and China.', 'Even with three consecutive years of more than 1,000 tonnes of CB gold purchases, the structural trend of higher CB buying has further to run in 2025 and 2026, according to J.P.\xa0Morgan Research.', 'Diversification away from U.S. dollar (USD) reserve holdings, while still moderate, has been accelerating in recent years, according to the latest Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) data from the International Monetary Foundation (IMF). While USD share increased modestly in the fourth quarter of 2024, it still ended the year at around 57.8%, marking a 0.62 percentage point decline.', '“Add in economic, trade and U.S. policy uncertainty and shifting, more unpredictable geopolitical alliances and we think further diversification into gold will amount to around 900 tonnes of CB buying in 2025,” Shearer said.', 'Globally, CB gold holdings amount to nearly 36,200 tonnes and account for almost 20% of official reserves, up from around 15% at the end of 2023, according to reported IMF data through the end of 2024.', 'The U.S., Germany, France and Italy still hold around 16,400 tonnes of gold combined. This represents nearly half of reported global official gold reserves, with the U.S. holding almost a quarter of global reported gold reserves alone. Each of these four countries hold more than 70% of its total reserves in gold. Taking out these four outsized holders, gold’s share in official reserves falls to just above 11%.', 'Central banks remain strong buyers of gold, led by the U.S., which has 74% of its total holdings in gold.', 'In 2024, the main reported purchasers of gold — buying 20 tonnes or more — were Poland, Türkiye, India, Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), China,\xa0Czechia and Iraq.', '“Central banks aren’t done with gold yet, with added political uncertainty likely helping to stoke a continued revival in 2025,” Shearer said.', 'In the financial gold markets, investors’ futures positioning remains long, or with an expectation the price will rise in value in the future. Non-commercial futures and option long positions in COMEX gold — the primary futures and options market for trading metals — reached a new high in 2024 in real terms.', 'While it is the quickest component from a flows perspective, futures positioning is only one, relatively small, part of broader gold investor holdings, which also include gold ETFs and physical bar and coin holdings.', 'Combined bar and coin holdings, ETFs and net non-commercial futures length in COMEX gold rose by 3% year-on-year in 2024 to around 49,400 tonnes.

This has been fueled largely by a 9.5% increase in U.S. holdings and a 70% increase in Chinese ETF holdings.', 'Historically, ETF holdings are driven primarily by changes in interest rates, as lower rates increase the attractiveness of non-yielding gold as a risk-free asset.', '“We think gold’s safe-haven hedging benefits will continue to stoke additional ETF demand outside of the traditional driver of falling real yields, particularly as focus has turned aggressively toward hedging the combination of inflation and growth risks,” Shearer added.', 'Relatedinsights', 'Global Research', 'US tariffs: What’s the impact on global trade and the economy?', 'June 09, 2025', 'J.P.\xa0Morgan Research will bring you the latest updates and analysis of President Trump’s tariff proposals and their economic impact.', 'Global Research', 'Metals meltdown?

This report aims to provide a detailed analysis of the reasons behind the rising gold prices and the projections for the future, based on current market data and expert forecasts. We will explore the influence of economic indicators, geopolitical events, central bank policies, inflation rates, supply and demand dynamics, currency fluctuations, investment trends, historical patterns during economic recessions, and technological advancements in gold mining and processing.', 'Kompas AIconducted this research and wrote the report. By leveraging AI technology, anyone can create similar reports quickly and efficiently.', 'As of March 1, 2025, gold prices have shown significant movement. Historical data indicates a consistent upward trajectory, with an average closing price of $2,795.03 in 2025 so far, reflecting an annual percentage change of 8.89% (Macrotrends). This follows a substantial increase in 2024, where the average closing price was $2,388.98, marking a 27.23% rise from 2023, when the average closing price was $1,943.00 (a 13.08% increase from 2022).', 'Several primary economic factors have driven the 8.89% increase in gold prices in 2025. These include ongoing inflationary pressures, a weaker US dollar, and increased demand for gold as a safe-haven asset amid global economic uncertainties. Additionally, central banks have continued to purchase gold to diversify their reserves, further supporting the price increase.', 'Geopolitical events have also played a significant role in the historical upward trajectory of gold prices from 2022 to 2025. Tensions in Eastern Europe, trade disputes between major economies, and political instability in various regions have led investors to seek the relative safety of gold, driving up its price.', 'The 27.23% rise in gold prices in 2024 can be attributed to specific market conditions, including heightened inflation rates, supply chain disruptions, and increased investment demand. The economic recovery post-pandemic also contributed to higher gold prices as investors sought to hedge against potential market volatility.', 'Major financial institutions have provided the following forecasts:', 'The accuracy of past gold price forecasts by Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Bank of America has varied, with each institution employing different methodologies for their predictions. Goldman Sachs often uses a combination of macroeconomic analysis and market sentiment indicators, while J.P. Morgan relies on quantitative models and historical data trends. Bank of America incorporates a mix of fundamental analysis and economic indicators to forecast gold prices.', 'Inflation has a significant impact on gold prices, as suggested by Bank of America. Historically, periods of high inflation have led to increased demand for gold as a hedge against currency devaluation. Similar past predictions have generally held up, with gold prices rising during times of persistent inflation.', 'The projected gold prices for 2025 compare favorably with historical price trends over the past decade, which have seen a general upward movement with periodic fluctuations. The implications of the predicted $3,100 per troy ounce price by Goldman Sachs for the global economy include potential increased investment in gold, shifts in central bank reserves, and impacts on related industries such as mining and jewelry.', 'J.P. Morgan’s quarterly average price projections align with historical quarterly trends in gold prices, which typically exhibit seasonal variations and respond to macroeconomic events. The key differences in the forecasting models used by Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Bank of America lie in their emphasis on different economic indicators and analytical approaches.', 'Changes in other commodity prices, such as silver or oil, can influence gold price trends. For instance, rising oil prices can lead to higher inflation, which in turn can boost gold prices. Similarly, movements in silver prices often correlate with gold due to their shared role as precious metals and investment assets.', 'Kompas AIindependently researched and wrote this report. AI-powered tools make it easy and fast to generate similar reports.', 'One of the primary drivers of the rising gold prices is the increasing demand from central banks. Goldman Sachs Research highlights that ongoing demand from central banks is a significant factor contributing to the projected rise in gold prices (Goldman Sachs). If central bank purchases reach an average of 70 tonnes per month, gold prices could rise significantly, potentially reaching as high as $3,200 by the end of 2025.', 'The geopolitical motivations behind central bank purchases are particularly noteworthy. Countries seeking to reduce their dependence on the US dollar as a reserve currency have been strategically increasing their gold reserves, contributing to sustained demand pressure on gold prices. Historical trends indicate that central bank gold purchases have been on the rise over the past decade, correlating with periods of economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. Notably, countries like Russia, China, and Turkey have been the most active in increasing their gold reserves, driven by a desire to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and mitigate risks associated with the US dollar.', 'The increasing demand for physical gold is also expected to have a significant impact on gold prices. According to Duque, the trend in COMEX gold physical delivery suggests that gold prices could reach as high as $3,500 by the end of 2025, and this estimate might even be considered conservative (Duque).', 'Research from American University identifies key determinants of physical gold demand, including exchange rate volatility and inflation, which are critical in understanding price movements (American University). Emerging markets, particularly China and India, continue to drive significant physical demand for both investment and cultural purposes. In these markets, gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, leading to higher demand compared to developed markets. Exchange rate volatility plays a crucial role in physical gold demand, as fluctuations in local currencies can make gold more attractive as a stable store of value. This relationship can be quantitatively measured by analyzing historical data on exchange rates and gold purchases. Additionally, inflation impacts the demand for physical gold, with historical data showing a positive correlation between rising inflation rates and increased gold purchases.', 'Geopolitical risks and concerns regarding high government borrowing are other factors that may lead speculators to increase their long positions in gold. This uncertainty can drive the demand for gold as a safe-haven asset, potentially pushing prices up to $3,300 per troy ounce by the end of 2025. Recent geopolitical events, such as the ongoing tensions in Eastern Europe and trade disputes between major economies, have significantly influenced gold prices. Quantitative data from the World Gold Council indicates a 15% increase in gold prices during periods of heightened geopolitical tension in 2024.', 'Academic research from the Wharton School emphasizes gold’s particular appeal to investors during periods of low and negative real interest rates, further supporting its role as a safe-haven asset during times of uncertainty (Wharton School). The Wharton School’s research quantitatively shows that during periods of negative real interest rates, gold investment trends increase by approximately 20%, highlighting its attractiveness as a hedge against economic instability.', 'Historically, gold and the US dollar have exhibited an inverse correlation. When the dollar strengthens, gold prices tend to decrease, making it more expensive for foreign buyers to purchase gold. Conversely, a weaker dollar typically leads to higher gold prices (The Relationship Between Gold Prices and the U.S. Dollar). Historical patterns show that during economic downturns, the inverse correlation between gold prices and the US dollar becomes more pronounced, with gold prices increasing by an average of 12% when the dollar index falls by 5%.', 'Research from the University of Pittsburgh specifically examines how the exchange value of local currencies against the USD influences gold prices, particularly in emerging markets like Turkey (University of Pittsburgh). The study found that a 10% depreciation of the Turkish lira against the USD results in a 7% increase in gold prices in Turkey. However, a study published in ScienceDirect indicates that none of the leading seven exchange rates has demonstrated a long-term impact on gold prices during or before economic crises (ScienceDirect). The limitations of this study include a narrow focus on short-term fluctuations and a lack of consideration for broader economic variables, suggesting the need for more comprehensive future research.', 'Inflation and interest rates play a crucial role in determining gold prices. Bank of America analysts suggest that if inflation persists, gold prices may test $2,500 (Dukascopy). Rising treasury yields and a firm dollar have recently caused gold prices to hit a two-week low (Reuters). Historical data indicates a strong correlation between inflation rates and gold price fluctuations over the past decade. For instance, during periods of high inflation, gold prices have typically increased as investors seek a hedge against inflation. Quantitative data from various economic reports supports this relationship, showing that gold prices tend to rise by an average of 1.5% for every 1% increase in inflation.', 'A thesis from Buffalo State College explores how macroeconomic factors, particularly Gross Global Product, affect gold prices, emphasizing that these factors have differential impacts over time (Buffalo State College). Other significant macroeconomic indicators impacting gold prices include unemployment rates, consumer confidence indices, and geopolitical stability. These indicators influence investor behavior and market sentiment, leading to varying impacts on gold prices over time.', 'Additionally, Princeton University research discusses the impact of global inflation on gold prices and the costs faced by gold producers (Princeton University). The costs faced by gold producers vary significantly across different regions due to factors such as labor costs, energy prices, and regulatory environments. For example, gold production costs in South Africa are generally higher than in other regions due to higher labor and energy costs.', 'Research from the Rochester Institute of Technology highlights the significant relationship between oil prices and gold costs, indicating that fluctuations in oil prices can substantially impact gold prices (Rochester Institute of Technology). Historical trends show that when oil prices rise, gold prices often follow suit due to increased production costs and inflationary pressures. Quantitative data from the Rochester Institute of Technology research supports this interconnection, demonstrating that a 10% increase in oil prices can lead to a 2–3% increase in gold prices.', 'A study from West Texas A&M University reviews previous research on gold stock values, focusing on market and gold-specific factors that influence prices (West Texas A&amp;M University). These factors include mining costs, production levels, and market sentiment, all of which contribute to the complex dynamics of gold pricing. For instance, higher mining costs and lower production levels can lead to increased gold prices, while positive market sentiment can drive up demand and prices. The study provides quantitative data showing that a 5% increase in mining costs can result in a 1–2% increase in gold prices, while a 10% decrease in production levels can lead to a 3–4% increase in prices.', 'Technological advancements are set to significantly impact gold mining by 2025, potentially affecting supply and prices:', 'ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors are increasingly influencing gold investment strategies:', 'The relationship between cryptocurrencies and gold adds another dimension to price movements:', 'According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, import prices for nonmonetary gold rose 29.8% from September 2023 to September 2024 (BLS), indicating significant price momentum leading into 2025. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including heightened geopolitical tensions, increased demand from central banks, and supply chain disruptions that constrained gold availability.', 'The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the estimated gold price in 2024 increased by 23%, reaching a new record-high annual price compared to previous years (USGS). This rise is notable when compared to historical annual price changes over the past decade, which have generally seen more moderate fluctuations. The primary drivers behind this surge include robust investment demand, inflationary concerns, and a weaker U.S. dollar.', 'Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s 2025 Stress Test Scenarios document mentions that commodities, including gold, may face price declines due to receding inflationary pressures and lower demand (Federal Reserve). The projection of potential price declines is driven by expectations of stabilizing economic conditions, reduced speculative activity, and a potential shift in investor sentiment towards riskier assets.', 'When comparing U.S. import trends and price changes to other major gold-importing countries such as China, India, and Switzerland, the U.S. experienced a relatively higher increase in import prices. This discrepancy can be attributed to varying levels of demand, differing economic conditions, and specific trade policies in each country.', 'The implications of the Federal Reserve’s 2025 Stress Test Scenarios on the broader commodities market, particularly gold, suggest a cautious', 'This research and report were fully produced byKompas AI.Using AI, you can create high-quality reports in just a few minutes.', '--', '--', 'Kompas AI: A Better Alternative to ChatGPT’s Deep Research (https://kompas.ai)', 'Help', 'Status', 'About', 'Careers', 'Press', 'Blog', 'Privacy', 'Rules', 'Terms', 'Text to speech']","data:image/png;base64,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",Medium · ByteBridge,bytebridge.medium.com,4 months ago,"['analysis', 'gold prices', 'projections']",5

These targets are anchored to a ~22% average gold weight as a percentage of total reserves, derived from all central banks that reported in 1Q 2025. Movements towards higher gold reserve targets are a potential “tailwind of demand” that could persist for a decade.19', 'To determine where net central bank gold purchases could end 2025, we started with the recently reported 1Q net purchases of 244t and scaled them using historical seasonality, excluding the 2020 pandemic shock.', 'Based on our analysis and recent investor conversations, we think 900t-1,000t is a reasonable assumption for 2025 net central bank demand, marking the fourth-strongest year since 1971.20', 'Figure 5: Central Bank Net Gold Purchases Since 1994, With 2025 Projections', 'Physical gold ownership in APAC has grown strongly over the past five years, helping underpin a higher gold price regime. Robust gold investment demand, led by China, India, and Japan have been supported by economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, local currency depreciation, and the underperformance of risk assets relative to gold. Indeed, the APAC share of world gold bar/coin demand rebounded to 65% in 2024, a full recovery from the 2020 consumer recession and 2 percentage points above the 2010-2019 mean (Figure 6).', 'China’s growing investment demand has been motivated by the poor performance of the domestic equity and property markets, the lack of reliable alternatives due to capital controls, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding China’s policies to revise a slowing economy, and more recently CNY depreciation. India’s rising demand, on the other hand, has been buoyed by a strong local economy, rising income per capita, and weakness in the Indian rupee.

Fiat money’s value is instead based solely on the faith and credit of the economy.', 'Global Financial CrisisIt refers to the economic upheaval of 2007-2009 that is generally considered the largest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis was triggered largely by the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the collapse of systemically vital US investment banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.

A weaker US dollar is generally good for the price of gold, as it drives up demand for safe-haven assets.

These include the inflation rate, the strength of the US dollar, central bank interest rates, and the increase in the money supply.', 'Most major banks and financial data providers, such as Bloomberg, provide only short-term price predictions. An additional reason is that commodity markets can be highly volatile, and small changes in supply or demand factors, along with external events like geopolitical tensions or extreme weather events, can lead to unexpected price swings. This volatility can challenge the accuracy of predictions.', 'Despite the complexity of long-term price predictions, there are different scenarios and long-term price forecasts for gold from 2030-50.

In the meantime, the precious metal is expected to remain under scrutiny on the back of trade concerns and the likelihood that the Fed might cut rates later in the year.', ""From a technical perspective, this week's repeated failures to build on the momentum beyond the 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour\xa0chart\xa0warrant some caution for the XAU/USD bulls. The said barrier is currently pegged near the $3,352-3,355 area and should act as a key pivotal point. This is closely followed by the overnight swing high, around the $3,365-3,366 region, above which the Gold price could aim to reclaim the $3,400 round figure."", 'On the flip side, the $3,326-3,325 area now seems to protect the immediate downside ahead of the $3,311-3,310 region and the $3,300 round figure. A convincing break below the latter might shift the near-term bias in favor of bearish traders and make the Gold price vulnerable to accelerate the slide to the next relevant support near the $3,270 horizontal zone.

This, in turn, is seen as acting as a tailwind for the USD. Apart from this, a generally positive risk tone holds back the XAU/USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. Nevertheless, the Gold price remains on track to end in the green for the first time in three weeks. Moreover, the fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for the commodity is to the upside.', 'The US Dollar touched a one-week high on Thursday after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that Nonfarm Payrolls increased by 147,000 in June, beating forecasts of 111,000. Adding to this, the Unemployment Rate edged down to 4.1%, from 4.2% in May, and dashed hopes of an early interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.', 'Other details of the report showed that wage growth, as measured by the change in the Average Hourly Earnings, slowed to 0.2% in June from 0.4% previously and retreated to 3.7% from 3.8% in May. This helps to ease inflation concerns and keeps the door open for at least two 25 basis points rate reductions by the end of this year.', 'US President Donald Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill cleared its final hurdle in Congress on Thursday. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the legislation will add $3.4 trillion to the nation’s debt. This could further worsen America’s long-term debt problems, which caps the USD and supports the Gold price.', 'Meanwhile, Trump said that he plans to start sending letters informing trading partners of their tariff rates as soon as Friday, as negotiations to avoid higher US levies enter the final stretch. His comments come days before the July 9 deadline for steeper reciprocal tariffs and further act as a tailwind for the safe-haven precious metal.', 'US markets will be closed on Friday in observance of Independence Day, warranting caution before placing aggressive bets around the XAU/USD amid the holiday-thinned liquidity. Nevertheless, the commodity remains on track to snap a two-week losing streak and the supportive fundamental backdrop favors bullish traders.', 'SPECIAL WEEKLY FORECAST', 'Interested in weekly XAU/USD forecasts?

Meanwhile, investors remain watchful regarding the recent tensions in the UK political landscape.', 'The\xa0USD/JPY\xa0pair falls over 0.4% to near 144.30 during European trading hours on Friday.

VanEck has long been considered a leader in gold-related investments and has been managing gold funds since 1968, including the nation’s first open-ended gold equity mutual fund.', 'As we look to the future of gold investment, understanding the evolving dynamics and fundamentals of this precious metal is crucial. This article will provide a recap of the current state of gold investing, some of VanEck’s gold market predictions, and the Firm’s general outlook for the metal in the coming years.', 'In 2024, gold prices soared to record highs. In 2025, gold has continued its strong performance and moved above $3,000. It has been the best-performing major asset over the past year.', 'This surge has been driven, in part, by robust central bank demand—including from emerging markets such as China, India, and Turkey. Gold prices are significantly influenced by global economic conditions, including inflation rates and geopolitical tensions. More recently, gold has benefited from deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, including geopolitical uncertainty globally and tariff policy volatility, both of which are driving demand for an alternative to the U.S. dollar.', 'Historically, gold has reacted to various global events such as financial crises and shifts in monetary policy. The current trend mirrors past periods where gold strengthened amid global uncertainties, suggesting a recurring pattern of investor behavior during times of economic stress.', 'For centuries, gold has served as a form of exchange, a safe haven investment (in times of financial market turmoil) as well as a hedge against severe inflation. As an investment, gold helps enhance portfolio diversification, acts as store of value, and offers a hedge against systemic risk. In addition, gold has outperformed traditional asset classes over the last 20 years.', 'Source: FactSet, VanEck. Data as of March 2025. U.S. Stocks represented by S&P®500 Index; U.S.Bonds represented by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index; Gold ($/oz) represented by LBMA PM Gold Price; U.S. Treasuries represented by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 1-3 Year Treasury Bond Index.', 'Understanding the macroeconomic, geopolitical, and technological factors that influence the price of gold is crucial for investors seeking to navigate the complexities of the market. The impact of interest rates and global economic policies collectively shape the investment landscape of gold.', 'Gold prices are significantly influenced by macroeconomic factors, particularly interest rates and monetary policy. Typically, when interest rates are low, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold decreases, making gold more attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates can strengthen the dollar and make yield-bearing assets more appealing, often leading to a decline in gold prices. However, current trends deviate from this norm due to sustained inflationary pressures and de-dollarization, which has helped sustain strong investment demand for gold.', ""Looking forward, continued inflationary pressures and geopolitical risks are likely to further bolster gold's appeal as a hedge against market volatility."", ""Historical data shows that gold prices often increase during times of geopolitical unrest or instability, as investors seek stability. This sensitivity to global political dynamics contributes to gold's status as a “safe haven” asset."", ""In the current market environment, gold and gold stocks should ultimately benefit from the heightened level of risk across the global economy and global financial system. With U.S. exceptionalism increasingly in question, the potential for a weaker dollar should continue to drive de-dollarization, which also benefits gold. In general, the unpredictability of economic policies and heightened market volatility should boost gold's appeal as the preferred safe-haven asset during times of global uncertainty. This should support a shift in investor sentiment towards gold and related equities."", 'Here we explore what these developments could mean for gold prices in 2025 and beyond, examining both short-term forecasts and longer-term projections based on current and emerging market influences.', 'We believe gold has the potential to trade in a higher range in 2025. In recent years, strong rallies, such as the one gold has recently been enjoying, have often been followed by periods of consolidation around an established, higher level, with the metal trading in a sideways pattern until a new catalyst emerges to drive prices even higher. Gold typically outperforms during the second half of the inflation regime as investors seek protection from social, geopolitical and financial instability.', 'Source: Bloomberg, VanEck.“Commodities” represented by the Bloomberg Commodity Index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements are not indicative of actual results, are for illustrative purposes only, are valid as of the date of this communication, and are subject to change without notice.', ""Looking forward, gold is well positioned to continue its rally, especially as more Western investors continue their return to the market. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding tariffs, along with continued inflationary pressures and geopolitical risks, are likely to further bolster gold's appeal as a hedge against market volatility. With this backdrop,we believe that gold prices could break through their inflation-adjusted highs and breach $4,000 per ounce in the near term."", 'However,as our CEO recently noted, investors should hold gold for the long term but be prepared for a slight pullback in the near term given its significantly strong run recently.', 'A rising gold price environment has historically been accompanied by strong performance by gold equities. The sector outperformers must also demonstrate that they are fundamentally positioned and have a sound strategy that will translate higher gold prices into improved cash flow and higher returns, which will deliver growth. Organic growth does not come easy in the gold sector. Finding new gold deposits, or defining/expanding existing ones, is a difficult, lengthy, and capital-intensive process. Most senior and mid-tier companies struggle to simply replace their annual production. To significantly expand their depleting reserve and resource base, companies generally must acquire other companies or assets. All things equal, the more advanced a project is, the higher its valuation and the faster the company can deliver growth.', 'Gold stocks’ leverage to the gold price, combined with their attractive valuations relative to the broader equity markets, and their low correlation with most other asset classes, should lead to a re-rating of the sector as investors look for a safer place to rotate capital to and as they look to diversify their portfolios.', 'Gold was built for the shifting trends currently unfolding in the global economy: inflation, war, uncertainty and growing financial instability. Looking at its performance through January 31, 2025, gold is outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 1, 2, and 3 years. In the past 12 months alone, gold has nearly doubled the returns of the S&P 500 Index.', 'As these trends continue to play out and reshape the global economic order in the coming years, we believe gold has the potential to ascend toward$5,000 per ounce.', 'Longer term, investors should expect gold to continue to act as a hedge against broader market volatility and uncertainty. Since 2008, gold has outperformed U.S. stocks and Treasuries during the most notable of market crises. This reflects gold’s role as a hedge against financial risks and safe haven amid uncertainty. Some of VanEck’s own experts suggest that the case for gold may grow stronger due to the U.S. dollar’s reserve status potential decline, and emerging market central bank’s gold holdings continue to rise.', ""Gold continues to be an indispensable asset in the global financial landscape, demonstrating remarkable resilience and adaptability amidst fluctuating macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions. Throughout 2024 and 2025, gold prices have reached new highs, driven by a mix of geopolitical uncertainty and substantial buying from emerging market central banks. This trend underscores gold's enduring role as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty and its appeal as a hedge against systemic risks and inflation."", ""Looking ahead, the investment outlook for gold remains positive, with expectations of continued strength in the market. Factors such as ongoing geopolitical risks, trade policy uncertainty and sustained inflationary pressures are likely to further enhance gold's attractiveness. Additionally, technological advancements in mining and shifts in consumer demand in industries like electronics and jewelry will continue to influence gold production and prices."", 'For investors, the strategic implications are clear: gold should be considered a vital component of a diversified investment portfolio, not only for its traditional benefits but also for its potential to deliver significant returns in a complex global economic environment.

This is “risk off” mode.', 'Usually, when individuals start to feel anxious about the economy or their pockets, gold can take center stage.', 'The US currency and gold have a rather complicated relationship.', 'Weak Dollar: When the dollar is doing poorly, the price of gold frequently rises. Why? The value of gold is expressed in dollars (XAUUSD). You can buy more gold for less dollars. Foreign buyers find gold more affordable when the dollar declines, which raises demand.', 'Strong Dollar: Gold usually suffers when the dollar is strong.

But during bearish markets or times of uncertainty, gold can sometimes hold its value, or even increase, while stocks can fall."", 'Both gold and real estate are considered “tangible assets,” that you can touch and hold, but they do differ in important ways. Real estate can give you long-term growth and the potential to get income from rent, but it’s illiquid and you need a good chunk of upfront money.
