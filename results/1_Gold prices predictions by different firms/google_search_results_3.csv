We remain deeply convinced of a continued structural bull case for gold and raise our price targets accordingly,” Kaneva added.', 'J.P.\xa0Morgan Research now expects prices to average $3,675/oz by the final quarter of 2025, rising toward $4,000/oz by the second quarter of 2026.', 'Gold prices are expected to average $3,675/oz by the fourth quarter of 2025.', 'The precious metal surpassed multiple record peaks in 2024 and broke through the $2,900/oz barrier for the first time in February this year, as investors navigated market volatility following U.S. tariffs and heightened geopolitical risks. Prices peaked at $3,500/oz in April against a backdrop of unpredictable U.S. trade policy.', 'Traditionally, a weaker U.S. dollar and lower U.S. interest rates increase the appeal of non-yielding bullion. Economic and geopolitical uncertainty also tend to be positive drivers for gold, due to its safe-haven status and ability to remain a reliable store of value. It has low correlation with other asset classes, so can act as insurance during falling markets and times of geopolitical stress.', 'But given gold’s diverse and fluid drivers of demand at the moment, the metal has recently served both as a debasement hedge — or a form of protection against the loss of a currency’s purchasing power due to inflation or currency debasement — and in its more traditional role as a non-yielding competitor to U.S. Treasuries and money market funds.', '“We still think risks are skewed toward an earlier overshoot of our forecasts if demand continues to surprise our expectations. For investors,\xa0we think gold remains one of the most optimal hedges for the unique combination of stagflation, recession, debasement and U.S. policy risks facing markets in 2025 and 2026,” said Gregory Shearer, head of Base and Precious Metals Strategy at J.P.\xa0Morgan.', 'Following gold’s significant 30% rally, some investors have questioned who the major buyers of gold will be in 2025, with prices at current levels.', 'Underpinning the J.P.\xa0Morgan Research forecast for gold prices is continued strong investor and central bank (CB) gold demand, which is projected to average around 710 tonnes a quarter on net this year.', 'Central banks:', 'Consistently high levels of purchases by CBs (900 tonnes forecasted in 2025) are expected, given the current macro environment as well as a further expansion in investor holdings, particularly fromexchange-traded funds(ETFs) and China.', 'Even with three consecutive years of more than 1,000 tonnes of CB gold purchases, the structural trend of higher CB buying has further to run in 2025 and 2026, according to J.P.\xa0Morgan Research.', 'Diversification away from U.S. dollar (USD) reserve holdings, while still moderate, has been accelerating in recent years, according to the latest Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) data from the International Monetary Foundation (IMF). While USD share increased modestly in the fourth quarter of 2024, it still ended the year at around 57.8%, marking a 0.62 percentage point decline.', '“Add in economic, trade and U.S. policy uncertainty and shifting, more unpredictable geopolitical alliances and we think further diversification into gold will amount to around 900 tonnes of CB buying in 2025,” Shearer said.', 'Globally, CB gold holdings amount to nearly 36,200 tonnes and account for almost 20% of official reserves, up from around 15% at the end of 2023, according to reported IMF data through the end of 2024.', 'The U.S., Germany, France and Italy still hold around 16,400 tonnes of gold combined. This represents nearly half of reported global official gold reserves, with the U.S. holding almost a quarter of global reported gold reserves alone. Each of these four countries hold more than 70% of its total reserves in gold. Taking out these four outsized holders, gold’s share in official reserves falls to just above 11%.', 'Central banks remain strong buyers of gold, led by the U.S., which has 74% of its total holdings in gold.', 'In 2024, the main reported purchasers of gold — buying 20 tonnes or more — were Poland, Türkiye, India, Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), China,\xa0Czechia and Iraq.', '“Central banks aren’t done with gold yet, with added political uncertainty likely helping to stoke a continued revival in 2025,” Shearer said.', 'In the financial gold markets, investors’ futures positioning remains long, or with an expectation the price will rise in value in the future. Non-commercial futures and option long positions in COMEX gold — the primary futures and options market for trading metals — reached a new high in 2024 in real terms.', 'While it is the quickest component from a flows perspective, futures positioning is only one, relatively small, part of broader gold investor holdings, which also include gold ETFs and physical bar and coin holdings.', 'Combined bar and coin holdings, ETFs and net non-commercial futures length in COMEX gold rose by 3% year-on-year in 2024 to around 49,400 tonnes. This is dominated by around 45,400 tonnes held as bars and coins by private investors, according to World Gold Council data.', '“Central Banks aren’t done with gold yet, with added political uncertainty likely helping to stoke a continued revival in 2025.”', 'Gregory Shearer', 'Head of Base and Precious Metals Strategy, J.P.\xa0Morgan', 'With the price rally last year, the notional value of this holding increased by 31% year-on-year to around $4.2 trillion.', '“This put investor gold allocation back on par with levels last seen in 2010/11, and the notional value of this investor holding rose even more to $5 trillion by the end of last quarter,” Shearer noted.', 'ETF inflows have sharply gained momentum, with year-to-date total inflows amounting to 310 tonnes — translating to around 10% in total global holdings. This has been fueled largely by a 9.5% increase in U.S. holdings and a 70% increase in Chinese ETF holdings.', 'Historically, ETF holdings are driven primarily by changes in interest rates, as lower rates increase the attractiveness of non-yielding gold as a risk-free asset.', '“We think gold’s safe-haven hedging benefits will continue to stoke additional ETF demand outside of the traditional driver of falling real yields, particularly as focus has turned aggressively toward hedging the combination of inflation and growth risks,” Shearer added.', 'Relatedinsights', 'Global Research', 'US tariffs: What’s the impact on global trade and the economy?', 'June 09, 2025', 'J.P.\xa0Morgan Research will bring you the latest updates and analysis of President Trump’s tariff proposals and their economic impact.', 'Global Research', 'Metals meltdown?

This report aims to provide a detailed analysis of the reasons behind the rising gold prices and the projections for the future, based on current market data and expert forecasts.

Historical data indicates a consistent upward trajectory, with an average closing price of $2,795.03 in 2025 so far, reflecting an annual percentage change of 8.89% (Macrotrends). This follows a substantial increase in 2024, where the average closing price was $2,388.98, marking a 27.23% rise from 2023, when the average closing price was $1,943.00 (a 13.08% increase from 2022).', 'Several primary economic factors have driven the 8.89% increase in gold prices in 2025. These include ongoing inflationary pressures, a weaker US dollar, and increased demand for gold as a safe-haven asset amid global economic uncertainties. Additionally, central banks have continued to purchase gold to diversify their reserves, further supporting the price increase.', 'Geopolitical events have also played a significant role in the historical upward trajectory of gold prices from 2022 to 2025. Tensions in Eastern Europe, trade disputes between major economies, and political instability in various regions have led investors to seek the relative safety of gold, driving up its price.', 'The 27.23% rise in gold prices in 2024 can be attributed to specific market conditions, including heightened inflation rates, supply chain disruptions, and increased investment demand. The economic recovery post-pandemic also contributed to higher gold prices as investors sought to hedge against potential market volatility.', 'Major financial institutions have provided the following forecasts:', 'The accuracy of past gold price forecasts by Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Bank of America has varied, with each institution employing different methodologies for their predictions. Goldman Sachs often uses a combination of macroeconomic analysis and market sentiment indicators, while J.P. Morgan relies on quantitative models and historical data trends. Bank of America incorporates a mix of fundamental analysis and economic indicators to forecast gold prices.', 'Inflation has a significant impact on gold prices, as suggested by Bank of America. Historically, periods of high inflation have led to increased demand for gold as a hedge against currency devaluation. Similar past predictions have generally held up, with gold prices rising during times of persistent inflation.', 'The projected gold prices for 2025 compare favorably with historical price trends over the past decade, which have seen a general upward movement with periodic fluctuations. The implications of the predicted $3,100 per troy ounce price by Goldman Sachs for the global economy include potential increased investment in gold, shifts in central bank reserves, and impacts on related industries such as mining and jewelry.', 'J.P. Morgan’s quarterly average price projections align with historical quarterly trends in gold prices, which typically exhibit seasonal variations and respond to macroeconomic events. The key differences in the forecasting models used by Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Bank of America lie in their emphasis on different economic indicators and analytical approaches.', 'Changes in other commodity prices, such as silver or oil, can influence gold price trends. For instance, rising oil prices can lead to higher inflation, which in turn can boost gold prices. Similarly, movements in silver prices often correlate with gold due to their shared role as precious metals and investment assets.', 'Kompas AIindependently researched and wrote this report. AI-powered tools make it easy and fast to generate similar reports.', 'One of the primary drivers of the rising gold prices is the increasing demand from central banks. Goldman Sachs Research highlights that ongoing demand from central banks is a significant factor contributing to the projected rise in gold prices (Goldman Sachs). If central bank purchases reach an average of 70 tonnes per month, gold prices could rise significantly, potentially reaching as high as $3,200 by the end of 2025.', 'The geopolitical motivations behind central bank purchases are particularly noteworthy. Countries seeking to reduce their dependence on the US dollar as a reserve currency have been strategically increasing their gold reserves, contributing to sustained demand pressure on gold prices. Historical trends indicate that central bank gold purchases have been on the rise over the past decade, correlating with periods of economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. Notably, countries like Russia, China, and Turkey have been the most active in increasing their gold reserves, driven by a desire to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and mitigate risks associated with the US dollar.', 'The increasing demand for physical gold is also expected to have a significant impact on gold prices. According to Duque, the trend in COMEX gold physical delivery suggests that gold prices could reach as high as $3,500 by the end of 2025, and this estimate might even be considered conservative (Duque).', 'Research from American University identifies key determinants of physical gold demand, including exchange rate volatility and inflation, which are critical in understanding price movements (American University). Emerging markets, particularly China and India, continue to drive significant physical demand for both investment and cultural purposes. In these markets, gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, leading to higher demand compared to developed markets. Exchange rate volatility plays a crucial role in physical gold demand, as fluctuations in local currencies can make gold more attractive as a stable store of value. This relationship can be quantitatively measured by analyzing historical data on exchange rates and gold purchases. Additionally, inflation impacts the demand for physical gold, with historical data showing a positive correlation between rising inflation rates and increased gold purchases.', 'Geopolitical risks and concerns regarding high government borrowing are other factors that may lead speculators to increase their long positions in gold. This uncertainty can drive the demand for gold as a safe-haven asset, potentially pushing prices up to $3,300 per troy ounce by the end of 2025. Recent geopolitical events, such as the ongoing tensions in Eastern Europe and trade disputes between major economies, have significantly influenced gold prices. Quantitative data from the World Gold Council indicates a 15% increase in gold prices during periods of heightened geopolitical tension in 2024.', 'Academic research from the Wharton School emphasizes gold’s particular appeal to investors during periods of low and negative real interest rates, further supporting its role as a safe-haven asset during times of uncertainty (Wharton School). The Wharton School’s research quantitatively shows that during periods of negative real interest rates, gold investment trends increase by approximately 20%, highlighting its attractiveness as a hedge against economic instability.', 'Historically, gold and the US dollar have exhibited an inverse correlation. When the dollar strengthens, gold prices tend to decrease, making it more expensive for foreign buyers to purchase gold. Conversely, a weaker dollar typically leads to higher gold prices (The Relationship Between Gold Prices and the U.S. Dollar). Historical patterns show that during economic downturns, the inverse correlation between gold prices and the US dollar becomes more pronounced, with gold prices increasing by an average of 12% when the dollar index falls by 5%.', 'Research from the University of Pittsburgh specifically examines how the exchange value of local currencies against the USD influences gold prices, particularly in emerging markets like Turkey (University of Pittsburgh). The study found that a 10% depreciation of the Turkish lira against the USD results in a 7% increase in gold prices in Turkey. However, a study published in ScienceDirect indicates that none of the leading seven exchange rates has demonstrated a long-term impact on gold prices during or before economic crises (ScienceDirect). The limitations of this study include a narrow focus on short-term fluctuations and a lack of consideration for broader economic variables, suggesting the need for more comprehensive future research.', 'Inflation and interest rates play a crucial role in determining gold prices. Bank of America analysts suggest that if inflation persists, gold prices may test $2,500 (Dukascopy). Rising treasury yields and a firm dollar have recently caused gold prices to hit a two-week low (Reuters). Historical data indicates a strong correlation between inflation rates and gold price fluctuations over the past decade. For instance, during periods of high inflation, gold prices have typically increased as investors seek a hedge against inflation. Quantitative data from various economic reports supports this relationship, showing that gold prices tend to rise by an average of 1.5% for every 1% increase in inflation.', 'A thesis from Buffalo State College explores how macroeconomic factors, particularly Gross Global Product, affect gold prices, emphasizing that these factors have differential impacts over time (Buffalo State College). Other significant macroeconomic indicators impacting gold prices include unemployment rates, consumer confidence indices, and geopolitical stability. These indicators influence investor behavior and market sentiment, leading to varying impacts on gold prices over time.', 'Additionally, Princeton University research discusses the impact of global inflation on gold prices and the costs faced by gold producers (Princeton University). The costs faced by gold producers vary significantly across different regions due to factors such as labor costs, energy prices, and regulatory environments. For example, gold production costs in South Africa are generally higher than in other regions due to higher labor and energy costs.', 'Research from the Rochester Institute of Technology highlights the significant relationship between oil prices and gold costs, indicating that fluctuations in oil prices can substantially impact gold prices (Rochester Institute of Technology). Historical trends show that when oil prices rise, gold prices often follow suit due to increased production costs and inflationary pressures. Quantitative data from the Rochester Institute of Technology research supports this interconnection, demonstrating that a 10% increase in oil prices can lead to a 2–3% increase in gold prices.', 'A study from West Texas A&M University reviews previous research on gold stock values, focusing on market and gold-specific factors that influence prices (West Texas A&amp;M University). These factors include mining costs, production levels, and market sentiment, all of which contribute to the complex dynamics of gold pricing. For instance, higher mining costs and lower production levels can lead to increased gold prices, while positive market sentiment can drive up demand and prices. The study provides quantitative data showing that a 5% increase in mining costs can result in a 1–2% increase in gold prices, while a 10% decrease in production levels can lead to a 3–4% increase in prices.', 'Technological advancements are set to significantly impact gold mining by 2025, potentially affecting supply and prices:', 'ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors are increasingly influencing gold investment strategies:', 'The relationship between cryptocurrencies and gold adds another dimension to price movements:', 'According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, import prices for nonmonetary gold rose 29.8% from September 2023 to September 2024 (BLS), indicating significant price momentum leading into 2025. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including heightened geopolitical tensions, increased demand from central banks, and supply chain disruptions that constrained gold availability.', 'The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the estimated gold price in 2024 increased by 23%, reaching a new record-high annual price compared to previous years (USGS). This rise is notable when compared to historical annual price changes over the past decade, which have generally seen more moderate fluctuations. The primary drivers behind this surge include robust investment demand, inflationary concerns, and a weaker U.S. dollar.', 'Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s 2025 Stress Test Scenarios document mentions that commodities, including gold, may face price declines due to receding inflationary pressures and lower demand (Federal Reserve). The projection of potential price declines is driven by expectations of stabilizing economic conditions, reduced speculative activity, and a potential shift in investor sentiment towards riskier assets.', 'When comparing U.S. import trends and price changes to other major gold-importing countries such as China, India, and Switzerland, the U.S. experienced a relatively higher increase in import prices. This discrepancy can be attributed to varying levels of demand, differing economic conditions, and specific trade policies in each country.', 'The implications of the Federal Reserve’s 2025 Stress Test Scenarios on the broader commodities market, particularly gold, suggest a cautious', 'This research and report were fully produced byKompas AI.Using AI, you can create high-quality reports in just a few minutes.', '--', '--', 'Kompas AI: A Better Alternative to ChatGPT’s Deep Research (https://kompas.ai)', 'Help', 'Status', 'About', 'Careers', 'Press', 'Blog', 'Privacy', 'Rules', 'Terms', 'Text to speech']","data:image/png;base64,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",Medium · ByteBridge,bytebridge.medium.com,4 months ago,"['analysis', 'gold prices', 'projections']"
