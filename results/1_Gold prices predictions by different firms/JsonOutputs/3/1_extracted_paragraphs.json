        "Gold prices have continued to surge in 2025 due to trade uncertainty and geopolitical risks. What is the gold price forecast for this year and beyond?",
        "Gold prices have rallied significantly this year, climbing as much as 30% year-to-date when they peaked at $3,500/oz in April, surpassing J.P. Morgan Research\u2019s previous forecasts.",
        "As markets weigh policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks, what is the outlook for gold prices in 2025 and beyond?",
        "\u201cEarlier this year, we examined the structural shift in gold\u2019s demand and geopolitically influenced pricing drivers fueling its rebasing higher, ultimately posing the question if $4,000/oz is in the cards,\u201d said Natasha Kaneva, head of Global Commodities Strategy at J.P. Morgan.",
        "\u201cTo answer the question \u2014 yes, we think it is, particularly now with recession probabilities and ongoing trade andtariff risks. We remain deeply convinced of a continued structural bull case for gold and raise our price targets accordingly,\u201d Kaneva added.",
        "J.P. Morgan Research now expects prices to average $3,675/oz by the final quarter of 2025, rising toward $4,000/oz by the second quarter of 2026.",
        "Gold prices are expected to average $3,675/oz by the fourth quarter of 2025.",
        "The precious metal surpassed multiple record peaks in 2024 and broke through the $2,900/oz barrier for the first time in February this year, as investors navigated market volatility following U.S. tariffs and heightened geopolitical risks. Prices peaked at $3,500/oz in April against a backdrop of unpredictable U.S. trade policy.",
        "\u201cWe still think risks are skewed toward an earlier overshoot of our forecasts if demand continues to surprise our expectations. For investors, we think gold remains one of the most optimal hedges for the unique combination of stagflation, recession, debasement and U.S. policy risks facing markets in 2025 and 2026,\u201d said Gregory Shearer, head of Base and Precious Metals Strategy at J.P. Morgan.",
        "Underpinning the J.P. Morgan Research forecast for gold prices is continued strong investor and central bank (CB) gold demand, which is projected to average around 710 tonnes a quarter on net this year.",
        "\u201cAdd in economic, trade and U.S. policy uncertainty and shifting, more unpredictable geopolitical alliances and we think further diversification into gold will amount to around 900 tonnes of CB buying in 2025,\u201d Shearer said."
