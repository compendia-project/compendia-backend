It gets more power, a significantly revised chassis, bespoke aerodynamics, a Track Mode and a few unique bits and pieces inside and out to help it stand out from the regular models.', 'It has a lot to live up to, and straight-line performance alone won’t cut it in a modern-day EV designed to appeal to driving enthusiasts.', 'Given how much we liked to drive the original Model 3 Performance, and despite the behaviour of Tesla’s head honcho, we were looking forward to some time spent on familiar Irish test roads in the new one.', 'Pros:Supercharger network, terrific value for the performanceCons:Poor damping and body control, a bit soulless', '• Aero updates for the Performance model• The Model 3 is about the same size as a BMW 3 Series• Bespoke wheels and lower ride height', 'The Tesla Model 3 was comprehensively overhauled in 2023, including an update to the saloon’s exterior in the name of both freshening up the design and enhancing the aerodynamics. Tesla doesn’t quote an official drag coefficient for the Performance variant, but the standard Model 3 has a figure as low as 0.219, making it one of the most aerodynamic cars in its class.', 'Viewed from the side, it’s unmistakably a Model 3, with a flowing roofline that merges seamlessly into the rear deck. Frameless windows and flush door handles maintain the clean, minimalist aesthetic (and yes, the exterior door handles are still infuriating to use), while new 20-inch forged alloy wheels, exclusive to the Performance model, work with the lower ride height for a notably more muscular stance.', 'The overall effect is subtle, especially in the ‘Stealth Grey’ paint of our test car but look closer and you’ll see there’s a small carbon-fibre boot spoiler, a more pronounced rear diffuser under the car and a new front bumper as well.', 'In terms of overall dimensions, the Model 3 is very similar in size to the BMW 3 Series saloon, and hence the electric BMW i4 fastback. The Model 3 sits between the slightly smaller Polestar 2 and the longer Hyundai Ioniq 6, while the Porsche Taycan is considerably larger.', 'For reference, the key dimensions of the Tesla Model 3 Performance are:', 'Length: 4,724mmWidth: 1,933mm (mirrors folded)Height: 1,431mmWheelbase: 2,875mm', 'If buyers want any paint colour other than white, they need to pay extra: it’s €1,300 for blue, black or grey, and €2,000 for the new ‘Ultra Red’ or ‘Quicksilver’ hues.', '• Awful indicator buttons on steering wheel• Large luggage volume• Minimal design, good quality', 'As in the regular Model 3 models, the interior of the Performance model is, we feel, blighted by a few key items, though the overall quality and selection of materials, fit and finish have taken a marked step up from the original.', 'Unfortunately, Tesla did away with steering column stalks completely. Selecting drive isn’t such an issue, even if it’s a bit odd to do it through the touchscreen, and the button for the wipers on the steering wheel is fine as well, but the indicator buttons are disastrous. No matter how much you get used to them, there are times where they are nigh on impossible to use correctly, for example on the exit of roundabouts.', 'We did notice that the new Model Y has an indicator stalk, so hopefully Tesla has seen sense and won’t continue with the button idea after this.', ""It's a shame there’s no head-up display in the car to show speed and other items, as you have to keep an eye on the large 15.4-inch display in the centre of the car instead. All Teslas are just a little too dependent on their touchscreens for our liking, and yes, there is voice control, but none of that makes up for the lack of physical switchgear. The BMW i4’s interface is far superior because it has a mix of both."", ""Some buyers will also be disappointed by the lack of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto - they're not even available as an optional upgrade."", 'Admittedly, the screen’s software runs smoothly and quickly, and kids will love it as it’s packed with gimmicks such as the fart noise generator and Christmas mode, but we suspect the novelty of all these extras will soon wear off and it’s no longer the only car on the market with built-in games. We do like that rear-seat passengers get their own eight-inch touchscreen, though.', 'And those in the back are generally well-catered for in terms of space, thanks in part to a flat floor, though don’t expect it feel as spacious as a Model Y, for example. The rear seat base is quite sculpted - to the benefit of those sitting in the outer two positions - meaning the centre seat is narrow, raised and not very comfortable. It’s better than the BMW i4 back there, but the Volkswagen ID.7 is far more spacious and comfortable.', 'There’s no chance you’d get a child booster or seat into the middle of the back of the Model 3, though there are the expected ISOFIX mountings in the outer seats. The glass roof above lets plenty of light in, thankfully.', 'Those rear-seat backs split 60:40 and fold down flat for those times you need to carry something really long, but the Model 3’s boot is large by the sector standards. Tesla quotes a capacity of 594 litres including a notably large under-floor area, though the saloon-style boot opening does limit access a little in comparison to the hatchback shapes of the i4 and ID.7. An added bonus for Model 3 owners is that there’s a large 88-litre storage area under the bonnet up front as well.', 'On the subject of practicality, we dislike having to use the touchscreen to open the glovebox, but the centre console is large and spacious, plus the angled wireless charging pad works a treat.', 'There isn’t a lot inside the Performance model to set it apart from others in the lineup, though there are a few slivers of carbon-fibre trim, and the sport seats are fabulous. They’re heated, ventilated and electrically adjustable, and while their extra bolstering is designed to hold you in place during cornering, they also prove to be exceedingly comfortable over prolonged periods of time.', 'There’s a decent sound system in place as well. Hidden behind the minimalist look are 17 speakers, dual subwoofers and dual amplifiers.', 'We can’t review a Tesla and not refer to its sometimes controversial “Autopilot” technology. As standard, the Model 3 Performance features Basic Autopilot, which is effectively adaptive cruise control with some auto-steering. Next up is Enhanced Autopilot for €3,800, which adds more functionality including auto parking and a ‘summon’ feature where you can get the car to come to you from its parking space.', 'Top of the tree is the ‘Full Self-Driving Capability’ (FSD) as Tesla calls it, but buyers should be aware that it’s nothing of the sort as there is no legislation to cover such a thing in this country. It costs €7,500 and comes with the promise that “in future updates your vehicle will be able to drive itself almost anywhere with minimal driver intervention.”', '• Two electric motors for 460hp• Seamless all-wheel-drive traction• Track Mode looks like fun', 'The Tesla Model 3 is available with either a single rear motor for rear-wheel drive or dual motors for all-wheel drive. Tesla is remarkably coy about the power outputs of its electric motors, but even the entry-level car has 245hp at its disposal. The Performance model lives up to its name by using a dual-motor setup producing up to 460hp and 660Nm of torque. All that allows for an official 0-100km/h time of just 3.1 seconds, and it feels incredibly quick at all times.', 'That sprint off the line is quite uneventful other than straining your neck muscles as the all-wheel traction ensures there’s no unseemly wheel scrabble. How urgent you’d like response to your accelerator inputs can be altered from Chill to Standard to Insane. The car is more pleasant to drive in the former two settings, unless you’re on a racetrack perhaps with your foot to the floor for sizeable portions of the lap.', 'There, you’ll want to play with the Model 3 Performance’s new Track Mode. It allows customisation of the driving experience including which end of the car you’d like most of the power coming from (‘Handling Balance’); how much help you’d like from the stability control (‘Stability Assist’); whether you want to optimise lap times or being able to play on track for longer (‘Powertrain Endurance’); and how much regenerative braking you want in use. You can also select post-drive cooling so the car is ready to go back on track quicker, and set up dashcam recording of your laps onto a USB flash drive, while a lap timer and g-meter are also built into the system.', 'We didn’t have the opportunity to try all this on a circuit, and we suspect most buyers won’t either.', 'On an interesting road, however, the Model 3 Performance can be fun. The chassis has been substantially altered from that in the other versions, including beefier brakes and firmer anti-roll bars, but the biggest news is the addition of two-level adjustable damping, plus a lower ride height to lower the centre of gravity.', 'Impressively, the Performance rides quite well, even when you’ve selected the Sport setting for the damping. It’s firm, sure, but not in a bone-jarring way. It’s far softer and easier to live with than any BMW M car, for example. However, neither is it as engaging or as exciting to drive as a BMW M car.', 'The Model 3 is competent undoubtedly, and it can carry high speeds through sweeping bends if you want it to, plus the steering is pleasantly direct and the nose swiftly responds to your inputs.', 'If you can sense a “but” coming, it’s that we found body control to be lacking at times, conspiring with the reduced ride height to cause rubbing of bodywork over more severe undulations. We couldn’t quite get to the bottom of where the rubbing was, but it was certainly disconcerting, and it reduced our confidence in the car. Even allowing for the fact that the conditions may have been slightly outside what might be called “normal” driving, this is touted to be a performance car, and no Mercedes-AMG, BMW M or Audi RS model would have struggled in the same situation.', '• Range of up to 582km• Fast DC charging of up to 250kW• Excellent Supercharger network', 'If range is your top priority, there are better options in the Model 3 lineup - such as the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive variant with an official range of up to 702 kilometres. Still, the Model 3 Performance manages up to 528km, which is more than adequate.', 'One of the major advantages of any Tesla is of course access to the company’s excellent Supercharger network of fast charging stations. They’re rarely fully occupied and it’s a truly hassle-free way to recharge when on longer journeys. The Performance model can recharge at up to 250kW on DC power, and it also manages up to 11kW on three-phase AC outlets.', '• Low running costs like all electric cars• Decent warranty on electrical components• More efficient than most high-performance cars', 'All EVs are cheap to run when compared with cars powered by engines. Not only is motor tax in the lowest bracket - at just €120 a year - but servicing costs are low as there are no regular oil changes and the like required, while brake wear is reduced as the car makes use of ‘brake energy regeneration’ through the electric motors.', 'Tesla quotes 16.7kWh/100km for the Performance model, which means the cost per km of driving would be significantly lower than in any comparable high-performance car with an engine. The Model 3 comes with a heat pump as standard, designed to reduce drain on the battery during colder months when you use the cabin heating more.', 'Obviously, you’ll not achieve that official consumption figure if you’re exploring the extra performance on tap regularly, and in our time with the car we achieved an average of in and around 21kWh/100km in a cold week.', 'The Tesla Model 3 Performance’s warranty package include a basic limited warranty on most of the vehicle for four years or 80,000km, five years/100,000km on the airbag system and a decent eight years or 192,000km for the battery and electric motors, guaranteeing at least 70 per cent battery capacity for that time.', '• Tesla Model 3 Performance starts at €65,499 in Ireland• “Autopilot” options are expensive• No other EV offers as much performance-per-Euro', 'Versus a starting price of €40,984 for the entry-level Tesla Model 3, the Performance version isn’t badly priced at €65,499. Indeed, that’s only about €10,000 more than the Long Range All-Wheel Drive variant and its extra equipment warrants the premium alone, never mind the mechanical upgrades.', 'On the Tesla website, a car finance example for the Model 3 Performance indicates a monthly payment of €1,092 based on an APR of 6.9 per cent, deposit of €9,825 and a 36-month term. Hire purchase at the same APR over the same time period is €1,510 per month (with a €16,375 deposit). It’s easy to tweak the terms to your needs on the site.', 'The Tesla Model 3 Performance is a real bargain, certainly when compared to other high-performance cars. And there are few notable electric rivals with the same remit. The Volkswagen ID.7 GTX isn’t as powerful, but it justifies its higher price with a much larger cabin and really, it’s in the class above.', 'The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, meanwhile, is far more driver-focused, but it’s more expensive. And this is getting repetitive, but the BMW i4, as excellent as it is, is also costlier than the Tesla, unless you consider the far less powerful eDrive35 variant.', 'There’s a lot to like about the Model 3 Performance, especially if you’re not bothered by the antics of Tesla’s CEO and you’ve decided you like the look of the updated Model 3. It’s usefully upgraded from its predecessor; there’s no doubt about that. For those coming from traditional high-performance cars with petrol engines, its immediate pace will be appealing, but keen drivers will find it lacking in involvement and excitement beyond its g-force-creating abilities.', 'Nonetheless, the Model 3 now feels of high quality, it’s spacious, relatively efficient and undoubtedly lives up to the billing in Performance guise. If you just want the most interesting Model 3, then it certainly is that, and it manages it without going over the top in terms of appearance. It is, in short, a great-value, subtle high-performance EV. There aren’t many of those about. At any price.', 'Does the Tesla Model 3 Performance have a ‘frunk’?', 'Yes, the space under the bonnet up front is quite large, measuring in at 88 litres.', 'How many child seats fit in the back of the Tesla Model 3 Performance?', 'Only two. There are ISOFIX points only in the two outer rear seats, as is the norm, but the central position is narrow and raised, meaning it won’t be possible to fit even a slender booster there.', 'Does the Tesla Model 3 Performance have a heat pump?', 'Yes, it does. It’s standard fit across the Model 3 lineup.', 'Does the Tesla Model 3 Performance qualify for the SEAI grant?', 'No, it does not. As the list price is over €60,000, the €3,500 SEAI grant is not available to buyers of the Tesla Model 3 Performance. Likewise, VRT must be paid for in full.', 'Has the Tesla Model 3 Performance been assessed for safety by Euro NCAP?', 'At the time of writing, no version of the updated Model 3 ‘Highland’ has been assessed by Euro NCAP. It did quite well when it was first tested in 2019, but the testing regime has moved on since then.', 'Want to know more about the Tesla Model 3 Performance?', 'If there’s anything about the Tesla Model 3 Performance we’ve not covered, or you’d like help in choosing between it and other cars, you can avail of our (completely free) expert advice service via theAsk Us Anythingpage.']","data:image/jpeg;base64,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",CompleteCar.ie,www.completecar.ie,https://www.completecar.ie › car-reviews › article › 2025...,['The 2025 Tesla Model 3 Performance']

In many ways, Tesla’s most affordable vehicle remains the archetype against which all other electric cars are compared. Given its strong everyday drivability, approachable starting price, and robust charging infrastructure, it’s no surprise the Model 3 is so popular—but Tesla’s appeal isn’t what it once was. Rivals to the Model 3 include the Hyundai Ioniq 6, BMW i4, and Toyota Prius.', 'Following thecomprehensive Highland updatethat was applied to the Model 3 for 2024, significant hardware changes are unlikely to occur for 2025. However, Tesla is certain to keep rolling out over-the-air software updates aimed at improving the Model 3’s features and capabilities over time.', ""There’s no denying that the updated Tesla Model 3 Highland issignificantly improved over its predecessor. It rides more comfortably, andthe cabin is quieter. There are more standard features and improved seating ergonomics. Driving range is about the same as before, but it was already quite good,albeit less than expected. Pricing doesn't change much, either, making the 2025 Model 3 seem like a great value."", 'Other appreciable aspects of the Model 3 continue, such as its user-friendly cabin layout and abundant storage capacity. However, Tesla’s peculiarities continue to complicate the Model 3 experience. There are no stalks behind the steering wheel, with those controls instead relocated to the steering wheel and infotainment touchscreen. That touchscreen contains nearly every setting and adjustment for the car, making simple tasks more complicated than they need to be. Despite continual software updates, the available self-driving software is stillin need of much more improvement.', 'Many aspects of the 2025 Model 3 show why it’s such a popular EV. Yet many of the EVs created to rival itnow outdo it in certain areas.', 'Several powertrain configurations are available for the 2025 Model 3. The base Long Range RWD model has a single rear-mounted motor that produces 257 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. InMotorTrendtesting, this Model 3 accelerated to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. Although it’s rated by the EPA at 363 miles of driving range, our real-world range testing of earlier versions of the Model 3 has yielded shorter-than-advertised results. However, the Model 3’s excellent efficiency will make it very cheap to fuel for those who can charge it at home.', 'The available Long Range AWD model has dual motors for electric all-wheel drive. Total output from these motors measures 394 hp and 377 lb-ft. With this power, the 0–60-mph time is reduced to 4.0 seconds. The Model 3 Long Range AWD is EPA-rated for 346 miles of range.', 'At a Tesla Supercharger, recharging the battery from 5 to 80 percent takes slightly more than 30 minutes. Although exclusive access to Superchargers has been a key perk for Tesla drivers, that privilege is lessening as the automaker opens its network to vehicles from other manufacturers.', 'To showcase the sporty potential of electric power, Tesla builds the Model 3 Performance. This dual-motor variant produces 510 hp and launches to 60 mph in a Tesla-claimed 2.9 seconds. Adaptive suspension, larger brakes, and aerodynamic body details further elevate the Performance’s performance. Inside, sport bucket seats are equipped, and within the touchscreen there are a variety of new settings, such as a Track model for driver-selectable motor torque split. Range falls to roughly 300 miles in EPA certification, potentially a worthwhile trade-off for the Model 3 Performance’s power.', 'In previous model years, the Model 3 has performed impressively in crash safety testing. The 2023 model received afive-star overall score from NHTSA.IIHS gave the 2024 Model 3 Good scores in each of the three crash categories evaluated. The 2025 model has not been rated by NHTSA or IIHS as of this writing.', 'Between its frunk and trunk, the Model 3 provides a lot of cargo space for a sedan. However, its passenger capacity is more average for the segment.', 'Legroom (front/rear)', 'Cargo Space (frunk/trunk)', '2025 Tesla Model 3', '42.7/34.5 inches', '3.1/21.0 cubic feet', '2025 Hyundai Ioniq 6', '42.3/39.2 inches', '0.5/11.6 cubic feet', '2025 BMW i4', '41.5/34.2 inches', '0.0/10.0 cubic feet (hatchback)', 'As ever, a 15.4-inch infotainment touchscreen dominates the Model 3’s dashboard. Nearly everything is contained within that touchscreen: the gear selector, climate settings, navigation, speedometer, small adjustments, and more. Although the screen provides access to a variety of media streaming services,Apple CarPlayandAndroid Autoare not available. Built-in gaming is provided to help pass the time while charging. An 8.0-inch touchscreen for the second row mirrors many of the primary touchscreen’s functions. Two wireless charging pads are in the front row, and several USB-C ports are placed around the cabin. The Tesla mobile app works as a key for the Model 3 and grants ready access to the vehicle’s data points and settings, such as charge status or climate preconditioning. The app also allows a live view through the car’s Sentry security mode.', 'Tesla is well known for its autonomous and self-driving tech. As standard, every Model 3 comes withthe Autopilot suiteof driver assist and active safety features. Autopilot has functionality similar to many other mainstream 2025 vehicles, such as adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind-spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking, and automatic high-beams. Despite its optimistic name, Autopilot does not make the Model 3 drive itself.', 'However, the optional Full Self-Driving (FSD) software brings enhanced autonomous driving capability to the Model 3. With FSD, it’s possible to enter a destination in the navigation, press a few buttons, and have the car drive itself there, without any control input by the driver. An interior monitoring camera watches the driver to ensure they’re paying attention. Incidents ranging from sketchy to fatal with FSD have been well publicized, and in our experience the software is prone to erratic, uncouth behavior. Nevertheless, Tesla’s frequent software updates have brought gradual improvements to FSD.', 'With FSD, an automated self-parking feature is added, and it tends to work quite well. Choosing FSD also brings Actually Smart Summon, a feature that purports to let the Model 3 drive itself short distances to the driver under certain conditions. However, our experience with Actually Smart Summonindicates it’s a gimmick at best.', 'Tesla is prone to changing its vehicles’ pricing, but at time of writing the 2025 Model 3 starts at about $44,000 in Long Range RWD specification. The Long Range AWD model is approximately $49,000 to start. The Performance version seems like a sporty bargain at under $57,000.', ""However, there's big news for the 2025 Model 3: All versions are eligible for the full $7,500 federal tax credit. Other state and local incentives may be available. Tesla is also keen to advertise savings from not spending on gas, but Supercharging isn’t always cheap."", 'Sell Your Vehicle', 'Trade-in or sell your vehicle in just a few easy steps.', 'Get My Offer', '2025 Tesla Model 3', 'in Electric Luxury Compact Cars', 'Performance', '8.7/10', 'Efficiency/Range', '8.6/10', 'Tech/Innovation', '7.8/10', 'Value', '8.0/10', '8.6/10', 'Overall', ""Even before its long overdue update, the Model 3 was a good EV sedan, boasting strong performance and range.

Other refinement-improvement changes include double-glazed acoustic glass, improved suspension bushes, seals and sound-dampening materials.', 'The footprint is relatively similar though; at 4694mm long and 2088mm wide, including door mirrors, the Model 3 is shorter than the established junior execs, such as theBMW 3-seriesandAudi A4.', 'There are numerous changes inside, too, though we’ll talk about those later.', 'Tesla currently offers the Model 3 in four flavours: rear-wheel drive, Long Range rear-wheel drive, Long Range all-wheel drive and the Performance all-wheel drive car. This review deals with everything but thePerformance model.', 'The entry-level model gets a 323-mile range, 125mph top speed and a 5.8 second 0-60mph sprint time. The Long-Range model increases that to 436-miles, with the same top speed and a quicker sprint time of 4.9 seconds. Finally, the Long Range all-wheel-drive model has a slightly reduced range of 390-miles but it’s the fastest non-Performance model with a 0-60mph time of 4.2 seconds. Top speed is the same.', 'The rear-wheel drive model uses a 57.5kWh battery, while the rest of the range use a larger 79kWh battery. Any advancements Highland gets in range from the last model are down to aero efficiency improvements.', 'As for charging? Tesla quotes 175 miles in 15 minutes for all models in this review.', 'Technology might be the Model 3’s strong suit, but it can be rewarding to drive.\xa0The body rigidity is good, and overall refinement has taken a step forward over the previous version. The suspension is well-damped and firm, and very good at absorbing road noise. A good test of this was on a concrete section of motorway near to Tesla’s new regional office in the Midlands – many cars roar disapprovingly on the rougher local roads, but the Model 3 remains acceptably peaceful, and certainly better in that regard than a Polestar 2.', 'It’s pointy too, giving it a darty agility that you’d not usually associate with a 1800kg saloon. Like many other cars you can change the weight of the steering, and we found it most enjoyable in the firmest, Track mode. Overall, it works well with the bursts of speed you’d expect from an EV – even in non-Performance trim – making this Model 3 more engaging than you’d expect.', 'You’ll quickly learn taking advantage of the Model 3’s handling isn’t the best way to eke out the range though; it drops strongly when you take too many liberties.', 'We noted a few ergonomic inconveniences. The windscreen A-pillars are noticeably thick, and the rather ugly steering wheel is chunky to hold. One quirky detail which grated was the shroud around the forward-facing camera at the top of the windscreen, which kept masking the view ahead every time we looked at the rear-view mirror.', 'Even as you approach the interior, it’s apparent this car does things differently. There is no key, rather you use an RFID card (see below) or you can access the car via your smartphone.', 'In our testing, we ended up wafting the card up and down the B-pillar to find the secret spot rather too often – and then had to repeat the process inside,\xa0on the centre console, before the car would set off. This seems a backward step from the\xa0traditional keyless fob of the Model S\xa0(but may be circumnavigated if you place your pre-configured phone in the correct cradle and owners will quickly adapt).', 'This is a roomy and minimalist cabin. The windscreen is panoramic, and the scuttle is low, meaning that the view forwards is clear and commanding, even if you don’t sit with the seat in a high position. That full-length glass sunroof makes it bright and airy inside, and the floor is flat.', 'There are no buttons on the centre console, just a pair of roller-knobs on the steering wheel, four window switches on the door and (buried on the seat) the usual electric backrest and squab adjusters. It’s uncluttered and lovely – if\xa0you like controlling everything from a touchscreen.', 'Happily, the updated 15.4-inch screen is pin-sharp, high-res and unerringly logical, with the best navigation system available. It’s brighter than before\xa0and as easy to use than ever, although you’ll need to familiarise yourself first if you want to know where everything is. And, yes, it’s still stubbornly not compatible with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto – and you won’t miss them either.', 'Below the screen you’ll find twin\xa0fixed inductive pads that allow wireless charging of your phone. However your phone just sits there staring at you which is annoying because you can see it flashing with notifications.', 'Unusually, a tall adult can fit comfortably in the rear middle seat, thanks to a cleverly sculpted centre console armrest with space for that fifth person’s feet. However, those in the back will find their heads close to the panoramic roof, and if the driver gets enthusiastic in corners, there’s a real risk of banged heads on the bulky cant rail above the window.', 'Note also the unusual, thin chromed door handles. No auto-pop-out theatrics here: you tap one end, nudging the rest of the handle out to open it manually. They open from the inside differently, too – with a simple door switch that looks just like an electric window button. Finally, there are the new wheel-mounted indicators – on the move, they work just fine and you don’t even think about them, aside perhaps from on roundabouts.', 'Quality is more than acceptable for the money, and has ramped up again in the 2024 model. It’s a step-change over the ageing Model S and we’d say that users in this price bracket will be quite comfortable with the trim and materials used, with slush-moulded, soft-feel materials deployed throughout.', 'The range starts at the £39,990 rear-wheel drive model, but for just £5000 more you get a good amount of extra range in the Long Range rear-wheel drive model. Finally, the Long-Range all-wheel drive model gets you the best blend of range and performance. Out of the three, we’d likely go for the £45,000 Long Range RWD model, which gives you just enough of everything.', 'Outside of Tesla, the Model 3 should be compared with the Polestar 2 which it trounces in both drivability and practicality. It’s hard to be the Scandinavian style of the Volvo offshoot, though.', 'Of its other rivals, the BMW i4 is a sensational electric car, the Hyundai Ioniq 6 offers bonkers design, andthe Kia EV6is an awesome all-rounder, but as an overall ownership proposition, the Model 3 has nosed ahead of the lot.\xa0And that’s before we consider the punchier pricing.', 'With the Project Highland updates, the Model 3 finds itself vying for pole position on the mid-sized EV grid. The combination of the Tesla Supercharger network, an impressive battery range, and stylish, idiosyncratic interior have been sharpened up by improved ride quality, lower noise levels, and better efficiency than before.', 'The less-than-ideal customer service reported by some owners still is an important point to consider, as trust is hard earned and easily lost. Tesla is investing massively in the UK and is building an infrastructure to support its owners better. And that will be so important as it attracts the next tranche of buyers.', 'Throw in the cheaper pricing, and Tesla has given the legacy carmakers something to think about yet again. You win, too, because as usable electric cars go, it doesn’t get much better than this.', 'Specs below are for the Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive', 'We drive the facelifted Kia EV6 and, surprise surprise,...', 'We drive the facelifted Kia EV6 and, surprise surprise,...', ""BMW's electric 4-series is a force to be reckoned with -..."", ""BMW's electric 4-series is a force to be reckoned with -..."", 'We drive Hyundai’s wacky...', 'We drive Hyundai’s wacky...', 'All you need to know about the new Tesla Model Y SUV', 'A sector-by-sector guide to the best electric cars on sale...', 'Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.
