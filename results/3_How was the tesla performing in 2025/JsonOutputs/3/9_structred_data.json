It\u2019s also key to the improved aerodynamics that have allowed Tesla to squeeze an extra 20 miles or so out of the official range figures, making this one of the longest range electric SUVs you can buy."

More than that, the rear seats now fold flat electrically and the bootlid is powered, too. There\u2019s also a funky, magnetic loadbay cover that you can fold up and back, and that can also be stowed away in a dedicated cubby under the boot floor. Speaking as a dog owner, this sort of stuff is a lifesaver when you want to get the dog in the boot, but don\u2019t want to leave the loadbay cover behind."

Either of these are great value, as is the-entry level Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive that starts at \u00a344,990.
