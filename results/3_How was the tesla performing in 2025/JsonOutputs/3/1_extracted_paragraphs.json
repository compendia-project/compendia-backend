        "The new 2025 Tesla Model Y looks pretty cool in a Cybertruck-ey sort of way, and it\u2019s now comfier, and has even better tech and longer range.",
        "The Tesla Model Y. You don\u2019t really need me to tell you about it, do you? After all, it was the best selling electric car in the UK and across the whole world, in 2024. Oh, and in 2023. And yup, you guessed it \u2013 in 2022, too. So, this new one? It's pretty big news.",
        "This new 2025 Tesla Model Y isn't an all-new car; it's a facelift, so we\u2019re talking about the same platform as the'old' Model Y, but with a sleek new look inspired by the Cybertruck and Cybercab. It\u2019s also more aerodynamic, has a stiffer body shell to improve handling and comfort, and it\u2019s said to be quieter and more comfortable on the move.",
        "The Model Y remains much the same size, and at 4.79-metres long it\u2019s still a rival for a huge array of other electric SUVs, ranging from premium stuff like thePorsche MacanandAudi Q6 e-tronthrough to more affordable alternatives like theFord Mustang Mach-E, BYD Sealion 7, Peugeot E-3008,Skoda Enyaq,Kia EV6,Renault Scenic E-Techand Toyota bZ4X.",
        "For this 2025 Model Y, Tesla has given it a new fascia with a lower front splitter and a sleek, full-width headlight that\u2019s a bit reminiscent of theCybertruckor Robotaxi. Or of Cyclops from X-Men, if you ask me. You get the gist \u2013 it\u2019s all very futuristic and minimalist, and I actually rather like it. It\u2019s also key to the improved aerodynamics that have allowed Tesla to squeeze an extra 20 miles or so out of the official range figures, making this one of the longest range electric SUVs you can buy.",
        "The back of the Model Y looks cool, too. I really love the way the new light strip is hidden, and reflects onto the bodywork so that you get a sort of \u2018ambient\u2019 look to it. It's a bit different to the straightforward LED lightstrips that have become a bit ubiquitous on a lot of modern cars.",
        "The Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive has an official WLTP range of 311 miles, and a 0-60mph time of 5.6 seconds. The Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive has up to 387 miles of WLTP range and a 0-60mph of 5.4 seconds, with the Long Range All-Wheel Drive offering 364 miles of range (WLTP) and a 0-60mph time of 4.6 seconds. The Performance model is almost inevitable, but details haven't yet been confirmed.",
        "Rapid charging speeds peak at 250kW, which is nothing new for the Model Y, but still makes this one of the fastest-charging electric family cars. It\u2019s up there with the Porsche Macan, Audi Q6 e-tron and Kia EV6 for that, and will manage a 10-80% top-up in well under 30 minutes.",
        "You do lose 20-litres of space in the 2025 Tesla Model Y\u2019s boot, as a result of the new, electrically-folding rear seats, but the boot space is still pretty huge with a total load capacity of 2,138 litres including the frunk. More than that, the rear seats now fold flat electrically and the bootlid is powered, too. There\u2019s also a funky, magnetic loadbay cover that you can fold up and back, and that can also be stowed away in a dedicated cubby under the boot floor. Speaking as a dog owner, this sort of stuff is a lifesaver when you want to get the dog in the boot, but don\u2019t want to leave the loadbay cover behind.",
        "Up front in the cabin, there\u2019s some big news\u2026 And it comes in the form of the indicator stalk. This is controversial, because the \u2018Highlander\u20192024 Model 3became infamous for the indicator buttons on the steering wheel, which replaced its indicator stalk, and which many of us really didn\u2019t get along with. Not least, our illustrious leader, Ginny(you can check out her opinion, here).",
        "Tesla won\u2019t confirm that it\u2019s chosen to keep an indicator stalk on the Model Y because, well, there was a lot of hate for the indicator buttons on the 3. But it seems logical that that\u2019s why the Y has a \u2018precision engineered\u2019 stalk. Anyway, regardless of why it\u2019s there, we\u2019re very pleased that it is.",
        "The rest of the interior is improved with better material finish and ambient lighting, while the glass also reflects 26% more of the sunlight to keep the interior cool in the summer and reduce glare.",
        "As ever with the Y, space isn\u2019t a problem and even a tall adult will be alright in the back despite that swoopy roofline.",
        "The 15.4-inch touchscreen stays much the same, and is still your portal to all of the car\u2019s inner workings and functions, but obviously with Tesla\u2019s over-the-air software updates it\u2019ll always have the latest software. Still no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, but it\u2019s a good system regardless.",
        "Tech upgrades include improved wi-fi hotspot that\u2019s now got greater range and faster download speeds. The phone key performance has also improved thanks to the addition of \u2018ultra wideband\u2019. Nope, I don\u2019t know what that is, either, but it means that - if you set your phone up so that it functions as your car key for keyless entry and drive \u2013 the car will now sense your phone more reliably and from a bit further away.",
        "Other improvements include redesigned seats, which are usefully comfier than the seats you got in the pre-facelift Model Y. There's more side support in the front seats, and longer seat squabs in the back, and they feel a bit softer to me. Just nicer all round, really.",
        "The trademark huge panoramic glass roof is still standard, too, which makes the whole thing feel nice and airy. You also get an 8.0-inch colour screen in the back, now, which controls the climate control in the back, or you can do some gaming on it.",
        "Overall, the improved materials and new ambient lighting have lifted the feel of the Model Y\u2019s interior so that it now feels noticeably classier, even if Porsche, BMW and Audi don\u2019t need to worry about Tesla bettering their cabin quality any time soon.",
        "I spent a few days running around in the Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD (the Launch Edition, to be specific), and it is a noticeable improvement on the older Model Y. It\u2019s still not the comfiest in terms of ride comfort; there\u2019s noticeable thumps and jarring over patched up town roads, although it settles much better at higher speeds than the pre-facelift Model Y.",
        "A new steering wheel is another improvement; it\u2019s a bit slimmer and looks nicer, which only helps you to enjoy the fairly quick but well-weighted steering. It really does feel quite sporty, the Model Y. Not in quite the engaging, sports-SUV way that the Macan does, but it turns nicely into corners and generally feels keyed in. Just a bit sharper and more assertive than the Skoda Enyaq, really, although the Skoda\u2019s the better bet if you want a soft, cushy ride.",
        "Refinement is okay in the Tesla; again, it\u2019s improved but it\u2019s still not the best in class. There\u2019s a bit of wind noise, albeit nothing that\u2019s going to really bother you, and tyre noise is quite noticeable off the 20-inch Michelin tyres that were fitted to our test car.",
        "Performance? I mean, yeah, it\u2019s got that. The AWD Long Range manages 0-60mph in 4.6 seconds, so it\u2019s not short of acceleration when you want it, and you can really shock your kids if you want to.",
        "As with the Model 3, the Model Y only has one, heavy brake regen\u2019 setting that means you drive around almost all of the time just using the accelerator pedal \u2013 you barely need to use the brake pedal at all, although it\u2019s got perfectly decent feel and response when you do.",
        "Generally, it\u2019s a slick and impressive drive, the Model Y. A Kia EV6 is a bit sharper and more fun to drive (if a lot smaller inside), and the Enyaq is comfier yet misses out on the convenience and lower costs of the Tesla Supercharger network.",
        "Orders are open now and deliveries begin in May this year for the 'Juniper' Tesla Model Y AWD Long Range Launch Edition, but at \u00a360,995 it's surprisingly expensive and we'd say you're better off waiting a few weeks longer to get hold of one of the standard models.",
        "The Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive starts from \u00a348,990, while the Long Range All-Wheel Drive starting from \u00a351,990, which is actually some \u00a31,000 cheaper than previously! Either of these are great value, as is the-entry level Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive that starts at  \u00a344,990. Deliveries of these rather better value models are due to start in early summer 2025, so there's not too long to wait.",
        "All new Model Y vehicles include front and rear lightbars, acoustic glass, an 8-inch rear touchscreen, powered boot opening, customisable ambient lighting, and an additional front facing camera. The Launch Edition does get some upgraded features including ventilated front seats, some exclusive badging and kick-plate design, but it's really not worth the extra money, if you ask me.",
        "Enhanced Autopilot, which includes semi-autonomous lane-changes and motorway slip-road control (on top of the standard adaptive cruise control) is a \u00a33,800 option on every Model Y.",
        "'Full Self-Driving Capability' includes traffic light- and stop-sign recognition, and will also be updated automatically as Tesla introduces more upgrades in future. Mind you, it costs \u00a36,800 and we can't stress enough that it is not - I repeat, NOT - an actual self-driving mode. It is probably the best and most advanced semi-autonomous driving system on sale. But even with it fitted, a Tesla will not drive itself. And it's not going to drive itself any time soon. So don't be fooled by the very misleading 'full self-driving' name. Rant over...",
        "Overall, the new 2025 Tesla Model Y feels like more of the same \u2013 but better. We like all of the updates, including the style stuff, and the comfier seats and prospect of better ride comfort and refinement definitely sound good to us. It\u2019s great to drive, and now more comfortable as well \u2013 which was always our main issue previously.",
        "The price of the Launch Edition is, frankly, a bit too much. But the more affordable models are good value and promise impressive range, tech and practicality for the money \u2013 not to mention the ever-tempting convenience of the Supercharger network.",
        "We still prefer the Skoda Enyaq\u2019s comfier approach to life, but the Model Y remains one of the best electric family cars out there."
