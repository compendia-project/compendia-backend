        "After a significant update last year, the Tesla Model 3 continues to dominate the EV space for 2025. In many ways, Tesla\u2019s most affordable vehicle remains the archetype against which all other electric cars are compared. Given its strong everyday drivability, approachable starting price, and robust charging infrastructure, it\u2019s no surprise the Model 3 is so popular\u2014but Tesla\u2019s appeal isn\u2019t what it once was. Rivals to the Model 3 include the Hyundai Ioniq 6, BMW i4, and Toyota Prius.",
        "Following the comprehensive Highland update that was applied to the Model 3 for 2024, significant hardware changes are unlikely to occur for 2025. However, Tesla is certain to keep rolling out over-the-air software updates aimed at improving the Model 3\u2019s features and capabilities over time.",
        "There\u2019s no denying that the updated Tesla Model 3 Highland is significantly improved over its predecessor. It rides more comfortably, and the cabin is quieter. There are more standard features and improved seating ergonomics. Driving range is about the same as before, but it was already quite good, albeit less than expected. Pricing doesn't change much, either, making the 2025 Model 3 seem like a great value.",
        "Other appreciable aspects of the Model 3 continue, such as its user-friendly cabin layout and abundant storage capacity. However, Tesla\u2019s peculiarities continue to complicate the Model 3 experience. There are no stalks behind the steering wheel, with those controls instead relocated to the steering wheel and infotainment touchscreen. That touchscreen contains nearly every setting and adjustment for the car, making simple tasks more complicated than they need to be. Despite continual software updates, the available self-driving software is still in need of much more improvement.",
        "Many aspects of the 2025 Model 3 show why it\u2019s such a popular EV. Yet many of the EVs created to rival it now outdo it in certain areas.",
        "Several powertrain configurations are available for the 2025 Model 3. The base Long Range RWD model has a single rear-mounted motor that produces 257 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. In MotorTrend testing, this Model 3 accelerated to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. Although it\u2019s rated by the EPA at 363 miles of driving range, our real-world range testing of earlier versions of the Model 3 has yielded shorter-than-advertised results. However, the Model 3\u2019s excellent efficiency will make it very cheap to fuel for those who can charge it at home.",
        "The available Long Range AWD model has dual motors for electric all-wheel drive. Total output from these motors measures 394 hp and 377 lb-ft. With this power, the 0\u201360-mph time is reduced to 4.0 seconds. The Model 3 Long Range AWD is EPA-rated for 346 miles of range.",
        "At a Tesla Supercharger, recharging the battery from 5 to 80 percent takes slightly more than 30 minutes. Although exclusive access to Superchargers has been a key perk for Tesla drivers, that privilege is lessening as the automaker opens its network to vehicles from other manufacturers.",
        "To showcase the sporty potential of electric power, Tesla builds the Model 3 Performance. This dual-motor variant produces 510 hp and launches to 60 mph in a Tesla-claimed 2.9 seconds. Adaptive suspension, larger brakes, and aerodynamic body details further elevate the Performance\u2019s performance. Inside, sport bucket seats are equipped, and within the touchscreen there are a variety of new settings, such as a Track model for driver-selectable motor torque split. Range falls to roughly 300 miles in EPA certification, potentially a worthwhile trade-off for the Model 3 Performance\u2019s power.",
        "In previous model years, the Model 3 has performed impressively in crash safety testing. The 2023 model received a five-star overall score from NHTSA. IIHS gave the 2024 Model 3 Good scores in each of the three crash categories evaluated. The 2025 model has not been rated by NHTSA or IIHS as of this writing.",
        "Even before its long overdue update, the Model 3 was a good EV sedan, boasting strong performance and range. Now, the Model 3 is quieter on the road and features a more interesting cabin design. Don't trust Full Self-Driving."
