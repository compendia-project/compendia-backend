The base Long Range RWD model has a single rear-mounted motor that produces 257 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. In MotorTrend testing, this Model 3 accelerated to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. Although it\u2019s rated by the EPA at 363 miles of driving range, our real-world range testing of earlier versions of the Model 3 has yielded shorter-than-advertised results. However, the Model 3\u2019s excellent efficiency will make it very cheap to fuel for those who can charge it at home.",
