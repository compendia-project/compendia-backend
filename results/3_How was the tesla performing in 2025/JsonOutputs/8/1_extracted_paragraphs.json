        "The 2025 Tesla Model 3 Performance is the most driver-focused version of the updated \u201cHighland\u201d Model 3. It gets more power, a significantly revised chassis, bespoke aerodynamics, a Track Mode and a few unique bits and pieces inside and out to help it stand out from the regular models.",
        "It has a lot to live up to, and straight-line performance alone won\u2019t cut it in a modern-day EV designed to appeal to driving enthusiasts.",
        "Given how much we liked to drive the original Model 3 Performance, and despite the behaviour of Tesla\u2019s head honcho, we were looking forward to some time spent on familiar Irish test roads in the new one.",
        "The Tesla Model 3 was comprehensively overhauled in 2023, including an update to the saloon\u2019s exterior in the name of both freshening up the design and enhancing the aerodynamics. Tesla doesn\u2019t quote an official drag coefficient for the Performance variant, but the standard Model 3 has a figure as low as 0.219, making it one of the most aerodynamic cars in its class.",
        "The Tesla Model 3 is available with either a single rear motor for rear-wheel drive or dual motors for all-wheel drive. Tesla is remarkably coy about the power outputs of its electric motors, but even the entry-level car has 245hp at its disposal. The Performance model lives up to its name by using a dual-motor setup producing up to 460hp and 660Nm of torque. All that allows for an official 0-100km/h time of just 3.1 seconds, and it feels incredibly quick at all times.",
        "On an interesting road, however, the Model 3 Performance can be fun. The chassis has been substantially altered from that in the other versions, including beefier brakes and firmer anti-roll bars, but the biggest news is the addition of two-level adjustable damping, plus a lower ride height to lower the centre of gravity.",
        "Impressively, the Performance rides quite well, even when you\u2019ve selected the Sport setting for the damping. It\u2019s firm, sure, but not in a bone-jarring way. It\u2019s far softer and easier to live with than any BMW M car, for example. However, neither is it as engaging or as exciting to drive as a BMW M car.",
        "The Model 3 is competent undoubtedly, and it can carry high speeds through sweeping bends if you want it to, plus the steering is pleasantly direct and the nose swiftly responds to your inputs.",
        "If you can sense a \u201cbut\u201d coming, it\u2019s that we found body control to be lacking at times, conspiring with the reduced ride height to cause rubbing of bodywork over more severe undulations. We couldn\u2019t quite get to the bottom of where the rubbing was, but it was certainly disconcerting, and it reduced our confidence in the car. Even allowing for the fact that the conditions may have been slightly outside what might be called \u201cnormal\u201d driving, this is touted to be a performance car, and no Mercedes-AMG, BMW M or Audi RS model would have struggled in the same situation.",
        "If range is your top priority, there are better options in the Model 3 lineup - such as the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive variant with an official range of up to 702 kilometres. Still, the Model 3 Performance manages up to 528km, which is more than adequate.",
        "One of the major advantages of any Tesla is of course access to the company\u2019s excellent Supercharger network of fast charging stations. They\u2019re rarely fully occupied and it\u2019s a truly hassle-free way to recharge when on longer journeys. The Performance model can recharge at up to 250kW on DC power, and it also manages up to 11kW on three-phase AC outlets.",
        "All EVs are cheap to run when compared with cars powered by engines. Not only is motor tax in the lowest bracket - at just \u20ac120 a year - but servicing costs are low as there are no regular oil changes and the like required, while brake wear is reduced as the car makes use of \u2018brake energy regeneration\u2019 through the electric motors.",
        "Tesla quotes 16.7kWh/100km for the Performance model, which means the cost per km of driving would be significantly lower than in any comparable high-performance car with an engine. The Model 3 comes with a heat pump as standard, designed to reduce drain on the battery during colder months when you use the cabin heating more.",
        "Obviously, you\u2019ll not achieve that official consumption figure if you\u2019re exploring the extra performance on tap regularly, and in our time with the car we achieved an average of in and around 21kWh/100km in a cold week.",
        "The Tesla Model 3 Performance is a real bargain, certainly when compared to other high-performance cars. And there are few notable electric rivals with the same remit. The Volkswagen ID.7 GTX isn\u2019t as powerful, but it justifies its higher price with a much larger cabin and really, it\u2019s in the class above.",
        "The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, meanwhile, is far more driver-focused, but it\u2019s more expensive. And this is getting repetitive, but the BMW i4, as excellent as it is, is also costlier than the Tesla, unless you consider the far less powerful eDrive35 variant.",
        "There\u2019s a lot to like about the Model 3 Performance, especially if you\u2019re not bothered by the antics of Tesla\u2019s CEO and you\u2019ve decided you like the look of the updated Model 3. It\u2019s usefully upgraded from its predecessor; there\u2019s no doubt about that. For those coming from traditional high-performance cars with petrol engines, its immediate pace will be appealing, but keen drivers will find it lacking in involvement and excitement beyond its g-force-creating abilities.",
        "Nonetheless, the Model 3 now feels of high quality, it\u2019s spacious, relatively efficient and undoubtedly lives up to the billing in Performance guise. If you just want the most interesting Model 3, then it certainly is that, and it manages it without going over the top in terms of appearance. It is, in short, a great-value, subtle high-performance EV. There aren\u2019t many of those about. At any price."
