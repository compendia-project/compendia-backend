        "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has released its Q2 2025 vehicle delivery and production report. As per the report, the company delivered over 384,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2025, while deploying 9.6 GWh in energy storage. Vehicle production also reached 410,244 units for the quarter.",
        "Of the 410,244 vehicles produced during the quarter, 396,835 were Model 3 and Model Y units, while 13,409 were attributed to Tesla\u2019s other models, which includes the Cybertruck and Model S/X variants. Deliveries followed a similar pattern, with 373,728 Model 3/Ys delivered and 10,394 from other models, totaling 384,122.",
        "The quarter\u2019s 9.6 GWh energy storage deployment marks one of Tesla\u2019s highest to date, signaling continued strength in the Megapack and Powerwall segments.",
        "Tesla will share its full Q2 2025 earnings results after the market closes on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, with a live earnings call scheduled for 4:30 p.m. CT / 5:30 p.m. ET. The company will publish its quarterly update at ir.tesla.com, followed by a Q&A webcast featuring company leadership. Executives such as CEO Elon Musk are expected to be in attendance.",
        "Tesla saw some positive momentum during trading hours as it reported its deliveries for Q2.",
        "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) surged over four percent on Wednesday morning after the company reported better-than-expected deliveries. It was nearly right on consensus estimations, as Wall Street predicted the company would deliver 385,000 cars in Q2.",
        "Tesla reported that it delivered 384,122 vehicles in Q2. Many, including those inside the Tesla community, were anticipating deliveries in the 340,000 to 360,000 range, while Wall Street seemed to get it just right.",
        "Despite Tesla meeting consensus estimations, there were real concerns about what the company would report for Q2.",
        "There were reportedly brief pauses in production at Gigafactory Texas during the quarter and the ramp of the new Model Y configuration across the globe were expected to provide headwinds for the EV maker during the quarter.",
        "It is expected that Tesla will likely equal the number of deliveries it completed in both of the past two years.",
        "It has hovered at the 1.8 million mark since 2023, and it seems it is right on pace to match that once again. Early last year, Tesla said that annual growth would be \u201cnotably lower\u201d than expected due to its development of a new vehicle platform, which will enable more affordable models to be offered to the public.",
        "These cars are expected to be unveiled at some point this year, as Tesla said they were \u201con track\u201d to be produced in the first half of the year. Tesla has yet to unveil these vehicle designs to the public.",
        "Dan Ives of Wedbush said in a note to investors this morning that the company\u2019s rebound in China in June reflects good things to come, especially given the Model Y and its ramp across the world.",
        "He also said that Musk\u2019s commitment to the company and return from politics played a major role in the company\u2019s performance in Q2:",
        "\u201cIf Musk continues to lead and remain in the driver\u2019s seat, we believe Tesla is on a path to an accelerated growth path over the coming years with deliveries expected to ramp in the back-half of 2025 following the Model Y refresh cycle.\u201d",
        "Ives maintained his $500 price target and the \u2018Outperform\u2019 rating he held on the stock:",
        "\u201cTesla\u2019s future is in many ways the brightest it\u2019s ever been in our view given autonomous, FSD, robotics, and many other technology innovations now on the horizon with 90% of the valuation being driven by autonomous and robotics over the coming years but Musk needs to focus on driving Tesla and not putting his political views first. We maintain our OUTPERFORM and $500 PT.\u201d",
        "Moving forward, investors will look to see some gradual growth over the next few quarters. At worst, Tesla should look to match 2023 and 2024 full-year delivery figures, which could be beaten if the automaker can offer those affordable models by the end of the year."
