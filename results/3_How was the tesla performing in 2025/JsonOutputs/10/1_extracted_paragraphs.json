        "How do you fix one of the best-sellingelectric carsin the UK? That was the task for Tesla who have consistently seen the Model 3 and the Model Y in the top three sold EVs in the country. The answer is this; an updated Model 3 that\u2019s been improved and aggressively repriced: it now costs \u00a339,990 for the entry level rear-wheel drive trim.",
        "But just how good is the new Model 3 (codenamed Project Highland for those in the know) and is it still a match for the competition? After all, there are noweven more competitorsthan before.\u0000a0So is it any good? Keep reading for ourfull, thoroughverdict.",
        "Should I buy a Tesla Model 3?It\u2019s hard to discount the Tesla Model 3, even with the increased competition. More refined than ever, it still represents a strong choice.\u0000a0Keep reading for the full review.",
        "Pros:Smoother, quieter, better range and still fastCons:Still no driver display, some switchgear is fiddly",
        "Not so much, as this is more about evolution than revolution. Still, there are some changes obvious on the outside: the headlights are slimmer, the nose is sleeker, and they both make the face of the Model 3 a little more sophisticated and serious. It\u2019s the same story at the rear, which benefits from new, smoked tail-lights.",
        "That new styling also results in improved efficiency:\u0000a0The drag coefficient is now 0.219 \u2013 and with no changes to the batteries and motors, range has improved to up to 421 miles. Wind noise is also reduced by 30% according to Tesla. Other refinement-improvement changes include double-glazed acoustic glass, improved suspension bushes, seals and sound-dampening materials.",
        "The footprint is relatively similar though; at 4694mm long and 2088mm wide, including door mirrors, the Model 3 is shorter than the established junior execs, such as theBMW 3-seriesandAudi A4.",
        "There are numerous changes inside, too, though we\u2019ll talk about those later.",
        "Tesla currently offers the Model 3 in four flavours: rear-wheel drive, Long Range rear-wheel drive, Long Range all-wheel drive and the Performance all-wheel drive car. This review deals with everything but thePerformance model.",
        "The entry-level model gets a 323-mile range, 125mph top speed and a 5.8 second 0-60mph sprint time. The Long-Range model increases that to 436-miles, with the same top speed and a quicker sprint time of 4.9 seconds. Finally, the Long Range all-wheel-drive model has a slightly reduced range of 390-miles but it\u2019s the fastest non-Performance model with a 0-60mph time of 4.2 seconds. Top speed is the same.",
        "The rear-wheel drive model uses a 57.5kWh battery, while the rest of the range use a larger 79kWh battery. Any advancements Highland gets in range from the last model are down to aero efficiency improvements.",
        "As for charging? Tesla quotes 175 miles in 15 minutes for all models in this review.",
        "Technology might be the Model 3\u2019s strong suit, but it can be rewarding to drive.\u0000a0The body rigidity is good, and overall refinement has taken a step forward over the previous version. The suspension is well-damped and firm, and very good at absorbing road noise. A good test of this was on a concrete section of motorway near to Tesla\u2019s new regional office in the Midlands \u2013 many cars roar disapprovingly on the rougher local roads, but the Model 3 remains acceptably peaceful, and certainly better in that regard than a Polestar 2.",
        "It\u2019s pointy too, giving it a darty agility that you\u2019d not usually associate with a 1800kg saloon. Like many other cars you can change the weight of the steering, and we found it most enjoyable in the firmest, Track mode. Overall, it works well with the bursts of speed you\u2019d expect from an EV \u2013 even in non-Performance trim \u2013 making this Model 3 more engaging than you\u2019d expect.",
        "You\u2019ll quickly learn taking advantage of the Model 3\u2019s handling isn\u2019t the best way to eke out the range though; it drops strongly when you take too many liberties.",
        "We noted a few ergonomic inconveniences. The windscreen A-pillars are noticeably thick, and the rather ugly steering wheel is chunky to hold. One quirky detail which grated was the shroud around the forward-facing camera at the top of the windscreen, which kept masking the view ahead every time we looked at the rear-view mirror.",
        "Even as you approach the interior, it\u2019s apparent this car does things differently. There is no key, rather you use an RFID card (see below) or you can access the car via your smartphone.",
        "In our testing, we ended up wafting the card up and down the B-pillar to find the secret spot rather too often \u2013 and then had to repeat the process inside,\u0000a0on the centre console, before the car would set off. This seems a backward step from the\u0000a0traditional keyless fob of the Model S\u0000a0(but may be circumnavigated if you place your pre-configured phone in the correct cradle and owners will quickly adapt).",
        "This is a roomy and minimalist cabin. The windscreen is panoramic, and the scuttle is low, meaning that the view forwards is clear and commanding, even if you don\u2019t sit with the seat in a high position. That full-length glass sunroof makes it bright and airy inside, and the floor is flat.",
        "There are no buttons on the centre console, just a pair of roller-knobs on the steering wheel, four window switches on the door and (buried on the seat) the usual electric backrest and squab adjusters. It\u2019s uncluttered and lovely \u2013 if\u0000a0you like controlling everything from a touchscreen.",
        "Happily, the updated 15.4-inch screen is pin-sharp, high-res and unerringly logical, with the best navigation system available. It\u2019s brighter than before\u0000a0and as easy to use than ever, although you\u2019ll need to familiarise yourself first if you want to know where everything is. And, yes, it\u2019s still stubbornly not compatible with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto \u2013 and you won\u2019t miss them either.",
        "Below the screen you\u2019ll find twin\u0000a0fixed inductive pads that allow wireless charging of your phone. However your phone just sits there staring at you which is annoying because you can see it flashing with notifications.",
        "Unusually, a tall adult can fit comfortably in the rear middle seat, thanks to a cleverly sculpted centre console armrest with space for that fifth person\u2019s feet. However, those in the back will find their heads close to the panoramic roof, and if the driver gets enthusiastic in corners, there\u2019s a real risk of banged heads on the bulky cant rail above the window.",
        "Note also the unusual, thin chromed door handles. No auto-pop-out theatrics here: you tap one end, nudging the rest of the handle out to open it manually. They open from the inside differently, too \u2013 with a simple door switch that looks just like an electric window button. Finally, there are the new wheel-mounted indicators \u2013 on the move, they work just fine and you don\u2019t even think about them, aside perhaps from on roundabouts.",
        "Quality is more than acceptable for the money, and has ramped up again in the 2024 model. It\u2019s a step-change over the ageing Model S and we\u2019d say that users in this price bracket will be quite comfortable with the trim and materials used, with slush-moulded, soft-feel materials deployed throughout.",
        "The range starts at the \u00a339,990 rear-wheel drive model, but for just \u00a35000 more you get a good amount of extra range in the Long Range rear-wheel drive model. Finally, the Long-Range all-wheel drive model gets you the best blend of range and performance. Out of the three, we\u2019d likely go for the \u00a345,000 Long Range RWD model, which gives you just enough of everything.",
        "Outside of Tesla, the Model 3 should be compared with the Polestar 2 which it trounces in both drivability and practicality. It\u2019s hard to be the Scandinavian style of the Volvo offshoot, though.",
        "Of its other rivals, the BMW i4 is a sensational electric car, the Hyundai Ioniq 6 offers bonkers design, andthe Kia EV6is an awesome all-rounder, but as an overall ownership proposition, the Model 3 has nosed ahead of the lot.\u0000a0And that\u2019s before we consider the punchier pricing.",
        "With the Project Highland updates, the Model 3 finds itself vying for pole position on the mid-sized EV grid. The combination of the Tesla Supercharger network, an impressive battery range, and stylish, idiosyncratic interior have been sharpened up by improved ride quality, lower noise levels, and better efficiency than before.",
        "The less-than-ideal customer service reported by some owners still is an important point to consider, as trust is hard earned and easily lost. Tesla is investing massively in the UK and is building an infrastructure to support its owners better. And that will be so important as it attracts the next tranche of buyers.",
        "Throw in the cheaper pricing, and Tesla has given the legacy carmakers something to think about yet again. You win, too, because as usable electric cars go, it doesn\u2019t get much better than this."
