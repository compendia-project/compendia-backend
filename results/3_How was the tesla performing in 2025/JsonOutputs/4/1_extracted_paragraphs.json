        "Is it possible to write a review of any Tesla without mentioning its CEO Elon Musk? For better or worse, the company is synonymous\u2014symbiotic, even\u2014with Musk. After all,profits plummeted 71%amidst Musk\u2019s involvement with the Trump administration. But even if you disagree with his views and his activities in American politics, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed with what Tesla has achieved and its products. The company\u2019s Model Y wasn\u2019t just the best-selling EV in the world, it was the best-selling car in the world. Clearly, it\u2019s no chump.",
        "The TL;DR version:As a transportation device, the new Model Y is extremely capable. It's practical, comfortable, and priced reasonably.",
        "It\u2019s easy to mistakethe new Model Yas being an entirely new model because it looks so different to the one it replaces. But it\u2019s actually a facelift, not a brand-new model. However, as far as facelifts go, the changes are extensive. I\u2019ve written about the updates extensively inmy first impressions piece,and my colleague has coveredthe differences between the new and old Model Y hereso I would bore you with the details, but after having spent the past weekend with the latest Model Y, I\u2019d say the updates are largely successful.",
        "The styling changes are supposed to improve aerodynamics and add attractiveness. Tesla claims the drag coefficient has been reduced by about 5%, but this is hard to prove without access to a wind tunnel. What I can say, however, is that it looks contemporary. The entire front fascia is a lot sleeker and I think many will like the new full-width light bar that serves as daytime running lights. Though light bars are all the rage now, I worry that it\u2019ll age the car poorly in a couple of years. Only time will tell.",
        "The rear lightbar casts a soft glow and looks really nice when it's dark. Photo: HWZ",
        "The interior has also been updated to match the new Model 3. Rear passengers now have a screen for climate and media controls. Kids will love that it can also be used to watch YouTube and play games. And because there\u2019s ample legroom, the rear is generally a pleasant place to sit in.",
        "The other interior highlight is themassive panoramic glass roof. It stretches across the entire length of the car and gives the interior an incredible sense of airiness. It lets a lot of light in so it\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s silver-coated to insulate against heat. The coating does a good enough job as long as you have the air-con running. Park the Model Y outside on a sunny day and the interior will get as hot as a sauna. In these instances, you\u2019ll want to use the app to pre-cool the car before getting into it.",
        "Rear legroom is good for a car of its size. Photo: HWZ",
        "Drivers will appreciatethe return of the indicator stalk. This makes signalling so much more intuitive. There\u2019s still no stalk for the wiper controls and high beam\u2014you\u2019ll need to use buttons on the steering wheel for that\u2014and unless you spend a lot of time in a Ferrari, this will take some getting used to.",
        "I know readers want me to compare the ride of the new Model Yagainst its predecessor, but the fact is it\u2019s been nearly three years since I drove the old Model Y so I don\u2019t think I can make a fair comparison.",
        "The driver environment is as bare as ever. Note, the return of the indicator stalk. Photo: HWZ",
        "What I can say, however, is that the new car rides well. Tesla said it has improved the car\u2019s suspension and it shows.It soaks up undulations without fuss, but body movement remains well-controlled. Therefore, passengers never feel like they are in a boat on choppy waters being tossed around. Even on poorly paved roads it remains relatively composed. Not many SUVs in its price bracket can manage this trick. But it's not omnipotent, it pitches quite severely if you approach humps at an angle.",
        "Another contributing factor to the new car\u2019s improved ride comfort is the ability to reduce the strength of its regenerative braking. I\u2019ve always felt that the default level was too strong, so this feature is a godsend. Turning it down to the new Reduced setting enables the new Model Y to feel more like a traditional car and coast whenever you take your foot off the throttle.",
        "The front lightbar and headlights give the new Model Y is sleeker looking frontend. Photo: HWZ",
        "Tesla claims it doesn\u2019t affect range, but during my time with the car, I found that using it in the Reduced settingincreased power consumption by around 3kW/100km. In other words, reducing the brake regeneration could mean a range reduction of around 20%. That\u2019s not an insignificant amount, which means the more prudent thing to do would be to acclimatise to the heavy brake regeneration\u2014the sooner, the better. In fact, considering how imprecise the brake pedal feels, it\u2019s arguably better to get used to the default brake regeneration to slow the car down.",
        "It\u2019s quiet too. Like the facelifted Model 3, the new Model Y gets double-glazed glass throughout and more sound-deadening materials throughout the car. Tesla claims these changesreduce cabin noise by 20%and I can believe that. The serenity within the new Model Y is remarkable, even by electric car standards.",
        "The boot is huge and has a capacity of 854L. If you hold the rear seats down, it increases the capacity to a whopping 2,138L. Photo: HWZ",
        "The Model Y I tested was the Rear-Wheel Drive 110. Despite being the least powerful model in the lineup, it still felt quite brisk. Power output might just be110kW (148hp), but the car has a rather sizeable 350nm of torque. Plant your foot to the carpet and you will feel that instantaneous surge of power that only EVs can deliver. Tesla claims 0 to 100km/h in 9.6 seconds, but it genuinely feels quicker. It\u2019s only at around highway speeds that it starts to run out of breath.",
        "Power consumption duringmy test drive of over 350km was 14.6kW/100km. Given that the Model Y has a battery capacity of around 60kWh, one could get around 250km of range if you wanted to keep your battery between 20% and 80% charge. For longer trips where you\u2019d charge the battery fully, you could probably cover 400km before needing to plug it into a charger. These figures are all very decent for a car of its type.",
        "The new Model Y is a sensible update and is one of the most practical cars in its class. Photo: HWZ",
        "Tesla may not be making headlines for the right reasons now, but its ability to make objectively good electric cars is possibly irrefutable. And on the whole, this new Model Y is a more competent car than its predecessor. Yes, there are cheaper Chinese alternatives, but none matches the Model Y\u2019s levels of refinement. If you buy a car solely for getting around and transporting people and things, few can do it as well as the new Model Y."
