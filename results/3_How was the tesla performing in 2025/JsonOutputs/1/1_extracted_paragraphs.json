        "Tesla is flirting with a crisis as EV demand falters and Musk's cost-cutting actions within the U.S. government spark anger among consumers.",
        "Tesla is set to report first-quarter earnings on April 22. Will the quarterly report be another negative headline for the EV maker and its controversial CEO Elon Musk? Or, will Tesla surprise investors with outstanding cost performance or innovative tech advances? Decide now with this Tesla stock earnings release prep: a review of the company's recent performance, key data points to watch and consensus expectations.",
        "Tesla stock is down 38% in 2025. The stock price slide began after a disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report in January. Several negative headlines have since aggravated the decline, including:",
        "Recall and protest headlines indicate a tough first quarter for Tesla, which was confirmed by the company's latest production and delivery report. Still, investors are waiting for the official word on quarterly revenue, EPS, margins, energy business growth, progress on new products and AI initiatives and performance in China.",
        "Tesla reported global first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries on April 2. The company produced 362,615 vehicles and delivered 336,681 in the first three months of 2025. Relative to the prior-year period, production was down 16%, and deliveries were down 13%. The numbers, which were below analyst expectations, describe Tesla's worst quarter in three years.",
        "Things could change, but Tesla is not on course for a stellar 2025. For more promising picks for this year, see: best stocks of 2025.",
        "Tesla's disappointing first-quarter production and delivery numbers put investors on notice that this will be another tough revenue quarter. The final quarterly revenue and EPS data will hinge on vehicle pricing, energy and services revenue and overall cost efficiency.",
        "Tesla has been working to reduce its average cost of goods sold per vehicle. Between the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla lowered its average per-vehicle COGS from above $38,000 to below $35,000.",
        "Investors will want to see further cost progress. Lower costs support profitability and give Tesla more leeway for sales price reductions, a tactic the company has used to protect market share amid fierce competition.",
        "Energy is Tesla's smallest but fastest-growing revenue center. The energy business produced 10% of the company's total revenue in 2024, totaling $10 billion. This was up 67% from 2023. The gain almost offset the dollar-value decline in Tesla's automotive sales in the same period.",
        "New vehicle models and updates support Tesla\u2019s growth plans. The latest major product initiative was the 2023 Cybertruck launch. In 2025, Tesla plans to produce a cheaper car model and launch test markets for its robotaxi services. Investors are awaiting updates on both projects.",
        "The Cybertruck launch has been disappointing relative to Musk's early predictions. He had projected to sell 250,000 to 500,000 electric trucks annually. According to Kelley Blue Book, quoted by Benzinga, Tesla sold fewer than 40,000 Cybertrucks in 2024. Worse, third-party data from Cox Automotive indicates that Cybertruck sales have declined in 2025 relative to last year.",
        "Tesla uses AI in its business and products. AI enables manufacturing cost efficiencies and underpins Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) technology. The evolution of unsupervised FSD will be critical for the company's robotaxi initiative.",
        "China is Tesla\u2019s second-largest market after the U.S., accounting for an estimated 36% of sales. Tesla often does not break out sales figures by country, but the China Passenger Car Association tracks and reports vehicle unit sales by manufacturer. According to the China Internet Information Center, Tesla sold 137,200 units in the first quarter, up about 3% from the prior year.",
        "Tesla has been facing heavy competition from Chinese EV and hybrid manufacturer BYD. BYD recently launched a lower-priced EV to compete with the Tesla Model 3, long a top seller in China.",
        "According to Yahoo Finance, analysts expect Tesla to report first-quarter revenue of $21.81 billion and EPS of $0.43 per share. These numbers compare to revenue of $21.3 billion and EPS of $0.45 in last year\u2019s first quarter.",
        "Tesla has missed revenue and earnings expectations in five of the last seven quarters.",
        "Tesla\u2019s stock price has improved slightly since April 9, when Trump paused many reciprocal tariffs. However, the S&P 500 large-cap index showed the same trend, indicating general sentiment improvement rather than a Tesla-specific change.",
        "Bottom Line",
        "Tesla is flirting with a crisis as EV demand falters and Musk's cost-cutting actions within the U.S. government spark anger among consumers. The upcoming first-quarter earnings release will likely show flat-to-negative performance. Longer-term, Tesla could realize growth from its promised cheaper car model, unsupervised FSD and robotaxis\u2014so investors this quarter should watch closely for signs of progress on these initiatives."
