This dual-motor variant produces 510 hp and launches to 60 mph in a Tesla-claimed 2.9 seconds. Adaptive suspension, larger brakes, and aerodynamic body details further elevate the Performance\u2019s performance. Inside, sport bucket seats are equipped, and within the touchscreen there are a variety of new settings, such as a Track model for driver-selectable motor torque split. Range falls to roughly 300 miles in EPA certification, potentially a worthwhile trade-off for the Model 3 Performance\u2019s power.",
