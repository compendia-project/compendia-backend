China maintained its lead among major markets, with electric car sales exceeding 11\xa0million – more than were sold worldwide just 2 years earlier. Global sales were slightly tempered by stagnating growth in Europe, as subsidies were phased out or reduced in several major markets, and as the EU CO2targets for cars remained the same between 2023 and 2024. Electric car sales continued to increase in the United\xa0States although growth was about one-quarter that of the previous year. Significantly, outside of these three major markets, there was a record increase in sales of nearly 40% to reach 1.3\xa0million, closing in on the United\xa0States’ sales of 1.6\xa0million electric cars.', 'The rapid growth in electric car sales over the past 5 years has had a significant impact on the global car fleet: At the end of 2024, the electric car fleet had reached almost 58\xa0million, about 4% of the total passenger car fleet and more than triple the total electric car fleet in 2021. Notably, the global stock ofelectric cars displacedover 1\xa0million barrels per day of oil consumption in 2024. Of course, the stock of electric cars is not spread evenly across the world – in China, for example, around one in ten cars on the road is now electric, whereas in Europe the ratio is closer to one in twenty.', 'Almost half of China’s car sales were electric in 2024, representing almost two-thirds of electric cars sold globally', 'Electric car sales in China increased by almost 40% year-on-year in 2024, further driving up China’s share of global electric car sales. In 2021, China accounted for half of global electric car sales; this share grew to almost two-thirds in 2024. On a monthly basis, sales of electric cars have overtaken conventional car sales in the country since July 2024, bringing the share of electric car sales close to 50% for the full year. In China, 2024 marks the fourth consecutive year in which the electric car sales share grew by approximately 10 percentage points year-on-year.', 'The growth in China reflects in no small part thegrowing price competitivenessof battery electric cars with conventional cars in the country. In addition, China’s electric car market benefitted from the introduction of atrade-in schemein April 2024. The scheme, which is part of a wider economic stimulus package, applies to the purchase of conventional and electric cars alike, but with different levels of financial support. It offers CNY\xa020\xa0000 (Yuan renminbi) (USD\xa02\xa0750) for consumers that replace an older vehicle (conventional or electric) with a new electric car, and CNY\xa015\xa0000 (USD\xa02\xa0050) for replacement with a new conventional vehicle. In 2024, about6.6\xa0millionconsumers applied for the incentive, 60% of whom bought an electric car. As such, more than one-third of the over 11\xa0million new electric car sales in the country benefitted from this incentive.', 'In recent years, sales of plug-in hybrid electric cars have been growing faster than sales of battery electric cars in China. The share of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales, excluding extended-range EVs (EREVs)2, in China’s total electric car sales has risen from about 15% in 2020 to nearly 30% in 2024. Meanwhile, the share of EREVs has more than quadrupled since 2020, surpassing 10% in 2024. The acceleration of PHEV sales in China led the share of electric car sales that are battery electric to fall from 80% in 2020 to below 60% in 2024, though in absolute terms battery electric car sales increased sevenfold over the same period, demonstrating their continued appeal to new customers.', 'In Europe, electric car sales stagnated in 2024 as policy support waned in major car markets', 'About one in five new cars sold on the European market was electric in 2024, maintaining the sales share of the previous year. The electric sales share increased in 2024 in 14 out of 27 EU member states, while it either stalled or decreased in the rest, including in several larger markets, such as Germany and France, largely as a result of subsidies being phased out or reduced. InGermany, subsidies ceased at the end of 2023, whileFrancehas progressively reduced its subsidy over the years. At the start of 2024, France limited the amount of environmental bonus available to higher-income car buyers and reduced the number of vehicles eligible for the subsidy.', 'Besides subsidies, the policy design of the European\xa0Union CO2standards may also have held back further growth of the electric car market in 2024. As new targets come into effect every 5 years, car makers hadno incentiveto push sales of electric cars further in 2024 (in anticipation of strengthened targets in 2025). This is in contrast to markets such as the United\xa0Kingdom, where annually increasing targets move original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) towards electrification each year. In March 2025, the European Commission published itsIndustrial Action Planfor the European automotive sector, in which it proposed to amend the CO2emission performance standards for cars and vans, granting them additional flexibilities by averaging their performance over a 3-year period.', 'In the United\xa0Kingdom – the second-largest car market in Europe – electric car sales reached a share of nearly 30%, up from 24% in 2023. The year 2024 was the first under theVehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which required 22% of all new registrations to be BEV or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). When accounting for the scheme’s flexibilities, which allows OEMs to borrow credits from future years, they were able tocomplywith a battery electric car sales share of close to 20%. Norway reached near-total electrification of sales, with88%of car sales being battery electric and just under 3% plug-in hybrid. As a result of the growing stock of electric cars, Norway’s oil consumption for road in 2024 decreased by12%compared to 2021. From April 2025,a tax increaseon conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and PHEVs is expected to further increase the battery electric share towards meeting the Norwegian government’s 2025 goal of 100% zero-emissions car sales. In Denmark, the electric sales share increased by 10 percentage points to reach 56%, with nearly 100\xa0000 electric cars sold.', 'The market share of electric cars continued to expand in the United\xa0States', 'In the United\xa0States, electric car sales increased to 1.6\xa0million in 2024, with the sales share growing to more than 10%. However, growth in electric car sales slowed down significantly in 2024, increasing by just 10% compared to 40% in 2023. In spite of this, electric car sales did boost the overall car market, as sales of conventional cars stagnated.', 'A total of 24 new electric car models were launched in 2024, increasing model availability by 15% compared to 2023, providing consumers with more choices and further increasing competition. While the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 have been the two best-selling models in the United\xa0States since 2020, the 110 new models that have entered the market since then have driven the market share of Tesla down from 60% in 2020 to 38% in 2024. Furthermore, 2024 was the first year in which Tesla saw a drop in sales in the United\xa0States, while other OEMs saw sales increase by 20% on aggregate.', 'A modification to the US Clean Vehicle Tax Credit at the start of 2024 enabled buyers to receive an instant discount (up to USD\xa07\xa0500 for a new electric car and USD\xa04\xa0000 for a used electric car) at the point of sale, which may have served to entice interested buyers. However, not all electric cars were eligible for the credit: in 2024 about 20 electric models (not accounting for different trim levels) out of a total 110 were eligible, which translated to over half of US electric car sales. The real share that benefitted from the tax credit may be even higher. In 2023, provisions were introduced on leased electric cars toreclassifythem as commercial vehicles, thereby making them eligible for the tax credit without having to meet requirements on local manufacturing. As a result, by 2024, nearlyhalfof all EVs sold were leased, more than double the share seen 3 years earlier. In addition to the federal tax credit, in 2024,27 states offered additional incentives, rebates and exemptions promoting electric car adoption.', 'Electric car sales shares doubled in a number of emerging markets', 'In emerging and developing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa, electric car sales increased by over 60% year-on-year in 2024, and the sales share almost doubled from 2.5% to 4%. This rapid growth has been strengthened by policy incentives and the growing presence of relatively affordable electric cars from Chinese OEMs.', 'Emerging and developing economies inAsia(excluding China) saw a large increase in electric car sales, reaching almost 400\xa0000 in 2024, up over 40% from 2023. However, in India, total electric car sales and their share of sales increased only slightly, approaching 100\xa0000 (or 2%) in 2024. Thailand remained the largest EV market in Southeast Asia, despite a 10% drop in electric car sales. This decline was outweighed by an even steeper 26% drop in conventional car sales, largely due tostricter lending criteria, meaning the electric sales share rose to 13% in 2024, up from 11% the previous year. Within the region, Indonesia and Viet\xa0Nam also stood out, respectively tripling and nearly doubling their sales numbers and reaching sales shares comparable to countries such as Spain or Canada. In many Southeast Asian countries, BEVs are the most popular electric car type, with over 90% of all electric car sales being fully electric.', 'InLatin America, sales volumes and penetration rates doubled in many countries, with electric cars reaching a market share of 4% in 2024. Brazil towered over other countries in the region with nearly 125\xa0000 electric car sales, more than twice the number of 2023 sales, and the electric sales share doubled to 6.5%. Costa Rica, Uruguay and Colombia also achieved impressive sales shares of around 15%, 13% and 7.5%, respectively. These increases are in large part the result of governmentincentivessuch as tax exemptions, reduced registration fees, a relaxation of traffic restrictions for EVs, and relatively high fossil fuel prices.', 'InAfrica, electric car sales more than doubled to reach nearly 11\xa0000 in 2024. Sales shares remained low, at under 1%, though there was growth in several countries, such as Morocco and Egypt, where new electric car sales increased to more than 2\xa0000.', 'Emerging electric car brands are seeing local and even international success', 'Recent years have seen the birth of several new electric car brands in emerging markets, such as VinFast in Viet\xa0Nam, Togg in Türkiye, andTitoin Argentina, helping to drive up sales. In Viet\xa0Nam,local brands underpinned the near doubling of the electric sales share in 2024 to reach 17%. VinFast has also started to export to 11 different countries, with the largest share of exports going to Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia (44%) and Malaysia (22%), but also to the United\xa0States (22%).

In July 2024, the Turkish government announced aUSD\xa05\xa0billionpackage to boost its annual production to 1\xa0million electric cars per year.', 'India’selectric car market is predominantly supplied by Indian OEM Tata. In addition, at the end of 2023, Indian steelmaker JSW signed a joint venture with SAIC Motor, a Chinese OEM, to work together on car production under the name MG Motor. In 2024, the joint venture produced about half of its electric cars sold in India domestically, while the other half were imported from China. At the end of 2024,JSWalso announced the launch of its own EV brand, and is in talks with partners such as BYD and Geely regardingcollaborationon technology transfer.', 'Overseas expansion plans of Chinese producers, prompted by changes to import tariffs, drove sales in emerging markets', 'Another notable trend from 2024 was the numerous manufacturing announcements from Chinese OEMs in countries such as Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, where temporary exemptions from import tariffs for electric cars are coming to an end. In 2024, electric car sales inBrazilmore than doubled, with over 85% of new electric cars coming from China. A key factor behind this impressive growth was electric cars being exempt from import duties of 35%, though this exemption started to be gradually removed in 2024 and is set to end by the middle of 2026. By then, automakersBYDandGWMwill have begun producing models in Brazil, with a range tailored to the Brazilian market, such as BYD’sSong Pro, which will be flex-fuel compatible.', 'InThailand, Chinese imports play a key role in electrification, accounting for 85% of electric car sales. However, as in Brazil, this share is expected to decline due to changes introduced in theEV 3.5 program, under which import taxes on electric cars will be reintroduced at the end of 2025 and existing subsidies of up to THB\xa0100\xa0000 (Thai baht) (USD\xa02\xa0800) per imported car will be gradually phased out. To continue to qualify for theexemption and subsidy, OEMs must commit to producing at least two battery electric vehicles (BEVs) domestically by the end of 2026 for every imported BEV sold in 2024 and 2025.', 'InIndonesia, electric car sales tripled in 2024 while the conventional market contracted by 20%, leading to an electric sales share of over 7%. The government has supported adoption by reducing the VAT rate on electric cars from 11% to 1% since 2023. However, what has potentially had an evengreater impacton reducing the cost of electric cars for Indonesian buyers – and thus stimulating EV sales – has been the government waivingimport taxesfor EVs from car makers that invest in local electric car manufacturing from the start of 2024. Chinese car manufactures such asBYDandGAC Aionprofited from this reduction, as did European OEMStellantis. As a result, Chinese electric car imports increased 18-fold to 34\xa0000 by the end of 2024.', 'InMalaysia,electric car sales more than doubledin 2024 and the sales share increased from less than 2% in 2023 to nearly 4% in 2024.

On this basis, OEMs now only need to achieve the 15% emissions reduction target (compared to the 2021 baseline) on average over 2025-2027. This announcement was made in response toauto industry claimsthat the 2025 target would be unachievable, and would thus incur significant financial penalties that would damage the already struggling European auto industry. As yet, it is unclear how different OEMs will approach meeting the 3-year average target, in terms of the degree of under-performance that could be accepted in 2025 but would then need to be compensated for in the following 2 years.', 'The new phase of the CO2targets in the European\xa0Union is expected to drive up electric car sales, although the new flexibilities mean OEMs have less of an incentive to bring lower-priced electric cars to market this year. Given that a purchase premium for electric carspersistsin Europe, the phase-out of EV purchase subsidies in some European countries could place downward pressure on sales, but there are signs to the contrary. At the end of 2024, the electric car purchase subsidy in theNetherlandscame to an end, but electric car sales in the country in the first quarter of 2025 were about 10% higher than during the same period of 2024. In Italy, direct purchase subsidies for electric cars are no longer being renewed after 2024, though the government does aim to support the domestic production of EVs. In the first three months of 2025, electric car sales in Italy were up almost 50%.', 'Over the course of the year, electric car sales are expected to reach around 4\xa0million across Europe. In line with this, the share of electric cars sales would increase several percentage points compared to 2024, to around 25%. The increase in electric car sales across Europe is boosted by the UK Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which sets the target of 28% battery electric car sales in 2025.', 'In the United\xa0States,Executive Order 14154directed the government to reconsider market interventions that favour EVs. Legislation has since been proposed that would end the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit for both cars and light commercial vehicles. In 2025, this proposal may result in consumers that have been considering buying an electric car rushing to do so before the tax credit is removed. A dampening effect on EV sales in the United\xa0States is expected only once the tax credit is repealed, and the timeline for that is uncertain. In addition,tariffsfor conventional and electric cars have also been announced, which may result in lower car sales. For the full year, electric car sales in the United\xa0States are expected grow almost 10% in 2025, with a slight increase in the electric car sales share.', 'Across the rest of the world, electric car sales are expected to grow by over 30% to around 1.8\xa0million. This would mean electric cars account for 6% of all car sales outside of the three major EV markets in 2025, up from 5% in 2024. The strong growth seen in Southeast Asia and Brazil is expected to continue, reaching sales of more than 0.5\xa0million combined in 2025.', 'As electric car sales have grown over the past decade, government spending per vehicle, in the form of purchase subsidies and tax incentives, has steadily declined – a trend that accelerated in 2022 as subsidies were phased out.', 'In 2024, government spending accounted for less than 7% of total spending on electric cars globally, compared to 20% in 2017. In absolute terms, annual government spending on electric cars has hovered around the USD\xa038\xa0billion mark since 2022. At the same time, total consumer spending on electric cars globally has grown continuously to reach USD\xa0560\xa0billion in 2024.', 'China has had the largest absolute public spending since 2020, despite its subsidy scheme coming to an end in December 2022 after 12 years. Other incentives have remained in place – notably, electric cars being exempt from the 10% purchase tax that applies to other vehicles. In 2024, China introduced a trade-in subsidy with a higher premium for the purchase of EVs. The additional expenditure to support EV purchases is estimated to be around USD\xa02.7\xa0billion for 2024.4Nevertheless, Chinese government expenditure per vehicle dropped 25% between 2022 and 2024. China has the highest share of subsidies going to PHEVs, at nearly 45%, as a result of the 10% purchase tax exemption being applied to PHEVs, which are on average more expensive than BEVs. In contrast, government incentives for PHEVs have almost disappeared from other key markets.', 'In Europe, subsidy schemes were significantly reshaped in 2023 and 2024. The most abrupt change was in Germany, where the EUR\xa04\xa0500 per-vehicle subsidy was reduced to zero as of December 2023 – which was followed by a drop in EV market share of 4 percentage points in 2024. As a result, the German government has introduced newtax benefitsfor companies buying EVs, effective from July 2024 through to 2028. Company cars account for abouttwo-thirdsof registrations in the country.', 'In the United\xa0Kingdom, all subsidies were removed at the end of 2022 but electric car sales have continued to increase, thanks in part to theVehicle Emissions Trading Schemes, which set targets for zero-emission car sales starting from 2024. In addition, the growth in EV sales was underpinned by a set of tax rebates for company cars, which represented about60%of total car registrations in 2024. When factoring in allgovernment tax incentives, an ICE car would incur more than10 timesthe company car tax of an equivalent BEV, compared to Germany where this ratio is around4.', 'Similarly, Sweden ended its subsidy programme offering up to SEK\xa060\xa0000 (Swedish kronor) (USD\xa05\xa0800) per electric car in November 2022. Absolute volumes of electric car sales in the country decreased 10% in 2024, though the country’s EV sales share fell only very slightly due to a drop in overall car sales. In several other European countries, subsidies were either reduced in absolute terms, or their conditions have become more stringent, with a faster roll-back of subsidies for PHEVs. As a result, the average subsidy per vehicle in Europe has fallen rapidly, from more than USD\xa04\xa0500 per vehicle in 2022 to around USD\xa01\xa0000 in 2024. The phase-down or interruption of subsidy schemes in Europe has had differing consequences on EV market shares at the national level, but the rapid decrease in subsidies has not been followed by an equivalent decrease in EV market share, providing an encouraging sign of market resilience.', 'In the United\xa0States, the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act expanded the number of vehicles eligible for tax credits in 2023. However, the list of vehicles eligible for the USD\xa07\xa0500 tax credit has since changed repeatedly as Internal Revenue Service guidelines have been implemented. The average tax credit in 2024 was approximately USD\xa04\xa0000 per vehicle, since not all electric cars were eligible and some were eligible for only USD\xa03\xa0750.
