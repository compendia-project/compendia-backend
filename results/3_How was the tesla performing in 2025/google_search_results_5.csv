The longtime promise that Tesla will deploy millions of self-driving cars has boosted its market cap to $1 trillion, significantly more than any car company on the planet. But the reality is that Tesla makes nearly all of its money the way any other carmaker does: by selling cars. And that businesshasn’t been doing so hotlately.', 'The lackluster Q2 follows a similar decline in Q1, when deliveries fell 13% year-on-year and Tesla had itsworst quarter in over two years. It caps off a rough 18 months for the electric automaker. In 2024, Tesla’s sales flatlined for the first time in over a decade. It sold1.79 million vehicles globallythat year, slightly less than 2023’s 1.81 million.', 'Before that, the automaker saw years of exploding sales and more than enough demand. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, 936,172 in 2021 and 1.3 million in 2022.', 'The big question for months now has been whether or notTesla’s facelifted Model Y—its cash cow—could turn sales around and counteract the numerous headwinds the automaker is facing. Those include its CEO’s controversial politics, an aging vehicle lineup that lacks a cheaper model, increased hesitancy among EV buyers andthe flop that is the Cybertruck.', 'Tesla blamed its poor first-quarter sales on the new model, which had just been introduced and was being ramped up at factories around the globe.', 'A few months later, it doesn’t look like the new Model Y has been Tesla’s saving grace. The automaker doesn’t break out deliveries by model or region, so we won’t know how exactly the Model Y did until we see some third-party analysis.', ""The Tesla Cybertruck hasn't helped lift Tesla's sales."", 'Preliminary estimates from Cox Automotive indicate that Tesla’s sales in the U.S. specifically plummeted by 20% in Q2, as compared to the same period last year. That drove a 6% drop in overall U.S. EV sales, Cox says.', 'After a tough year and a half, Tesla isn’t out of the woods. It’s unclear whether the brand will ever recover from the reputational damage inflicted by Musk’s role in the Department of Government Efficiency.', 'And on top of that, major policy changes at the federal level threaten to stunt the EV transition in this country. The Senate just passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” whichkills off longstanding tax credits for used, new and leased electric cars. The federal government is taking aim at funding for EV charging infrastructure. And it aims to roll back vehicle efficiency regulations that benefit Tesla by incentivizing other carmakers to buy its lucrative regulatory credits.', 'Unlike Ford, General Motors and the other legacy automakers, Tesla can’t fall back on sales of gas-powered vehicles if EV demand slows down further.

The company’s stock has plummeted 50% from its December 2024 peak, marking nine consecutive weeks of decline. The shares, which rode a years-long wave of euphoria fuelled by Elon Musk’s visionary promises and breakneck growth, have tumbled amid a perfect storm of challenges.', 'This article will dissect the multifaceted collapse of Tesla’s stock price, exploring how the convergence of overhyped expectations, operational missteps, and market shifts have exposed the vulnerabilities beneath one of history’s most polarising market darlings.', 'For years, Tesla has soared on the wings of investor euphoria, trading at stratospheric multiples that dwarfed those of legacy automakers—a disparity that defied traditional valuation logic. As at 31 December 2024, Tesla’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio eclipsed197, a figure that starkly contrasted with the single-digit P/E ratios anchoring industry stalwarts like Toyota (10.81) or Ford (6.78). Even more audacious was Tesla’s market capitalisation, which briefly surpassed the combined value of the world’s top 10 automakers despite producing a fraction of their output.', 'Sceptics have long anticipated this correction, as most of Tesla’s US$1 trillion valuation zenith relied not on present-day fundamentals but on a mosaic of futuristic promises. Autonomous robotaxis, a self-driving ride-hailing network, humanoid Optimus robots, and AI-powered energy ecosystems were marketed as inevitabilities, not mere possibilities. Yet these ventures remain largely conceptual, with timelines slipping and regulatory hurdles mounting.', 'For instance, Tesla’s full self-driving (FSD) technology, touted as a recurring revenue ‘goldmine’, still requires human oversight after a decade of development, while robotaxis exist only as renderings and prototypes. Meanwhile, competitors like Waymo and Cruise are deploying autonomous fleets, eroding Tesla’s first-mover narrative.', 'As the market sentiment pivots from speculative growth to cash-flow pragmatism—a shift accelerated by inflationary pressures and geopolitical volatility—Tesla’s bubble has deflated rapidly, resetting its valuation to align with the gritty realities of automotive economics.', 'Tesla’s financial performance has deteriorated significantly, weakening margins and undermining investor confidence. Tesla posted a earnings miss for Q4 2024, withrevenue of US$25.7 billionfalling approximately US$1.5 billion short of projections. This underperformance has raised serious concerns about Tesla’s growth trajectory, especially as it coincides with the company’s first annual sales decline in its history during 2024.', 'Additionally, Tesla’s profit margin, excluding regulatory credits, hascontracted to 13.6%,significantly below analyst expectations of 16.2% and much narrower than in recent years. This margin compression reflects mounting competitive pressures and Tesla’s inability to maintain premium pricing in an increasingly crowded electric vehicle market. The reliance on non-operational gains is particularly concerning –US$600 millionof Tesla’s fourth-quarter profit came from increased bitcoin holdings rather than its core automotive business.', 'Tesla’s early-mover advantage in the EV market has substantially diminished as competitors have caught up. Legacy automakers like Ford and GM have leveraged their deep pockets and manufacturing expertise to develop compelling electric vehicles that directly challenge Tesla’s dominance. These established players bring decades of automotive experience and robust supply chains, allowing them to scale production efficiently and reach broad market segments.', 'Chinese manufacturer BYD has emerged as Tesla’s most formidable competitor, consistentlyoutperforming Teslain sales volume in China, the world’s largest EV market. BYD’s success is built on competitive pricing, strong government support, and products tailored to local preferences. The company’s international expansion, including apartnership with Uber to deploy 100,000 vehiclesacross multiple regions, signals its ambition to challenge Tesla globally.', 'BYD recently unveiled charging technology that candeliver up to 400 kilometres of range after just five minutes, surpassing Tesla’s quickest version, which provides 275 kilometres after 15 minutes. This advancement threatens one of Tesla’s key selling points – its supercharging network and battery technology. As competitors catch up technologically, Tesla’s differentiation in the market continues to erode.', 'Persistentquality concernsand unfulfilled promises have tarnished Tesla’s reputation. Many critics have repeatedly highlighted poor build quality in some Tesla vehicles, damaging the brand’s premium positioning. These quality issues become increasingly problematic as competition intensifies, giving consumers viable alternatives from manufacturers with longer track records of consistent quality.', 'Additionally,Tesla has a history of overpromising and under-delivering, such as missing production goals for new models and releasing products that look significantly different from initial announcements. This pattern undermines confidence in the company’s ability to execute its promises. The latest update indicates that its more affordable vehicle models are ‘on track for production to commence in thefirst half of 2025,’ while the Cybertaxi autonomous vehicle is anticipated for 2026. However, given Tesla’s track record, investors remain sceptical about these timelines.', 'The CEO’s growing political involvement has created significant controversy, potentially alienating a substantial portion of Tesla’s customer base. Tesla has experienced dramatic sales declines in markets where Musk has made controversial political statements. In Germany, where Musk’s provocative statements and perceived political alignments have raised concerns,Tesla registrations plummeted 76% in Februarycompared to the previous year.', 'Musk’s political activities havesparked protests, consumer boycotts, and even reported sabotage attacks on Tesla vehicles, charging stations, and production plants. These reactions indicate that Musk’s political positioning has alienated segments of Tesla’s traditionally progressive customer base, particularly in environmentally conscious markets where electric vehicles are most popular.', 'Investors have expressed growing concern about Musk being a ‘distracted CEO’ whose attention is divided among multiple companies and political activities. This distraction comes at a critical time when Tesla faces unprecedented competitive challenges and needs focused leadership in transitioning from a high-growth startup to a mature automaker competing in an increasingly crowded market.', 'Tesla’s stock decline represents a fundamental reassessment of the company’s prospects in light of intensifying competition, margin pressures, and leadership challenges. While the company maintains significant brand recognition and technological innovation advantages, these advantages have narrowed considerably.', 'For Tesla to regain investor confidence, it will need to simultaneously demonstrate progress on several fronts: improving production efficiency to boost margins, accelerating technological development to maintain differentiation, addressing quality concerns, and delivering on promises of more affordable vehicles. Perhaps most critically, Musk may need to refocus his time on Tesla’s operational challenges.', 'The era of ‘growth at any cost’ is over; the age of accountability has begun. The current correction in Tesla’s stock could be beneficial in the long term by bringing expectations back to realistic levels. However, the stock will likely remain volatile in the near term as the market continues to recalibrate Tesla’s value proposition in an increasingly competitive electric vehicle landscape.', ""Get up to speed with this INVEST Manual that'll show you how to be profitable in the stock market - Written in simple English that's extremely easy to understand, yet packs plenty of valuable profit strategies every investor must know..."", 'Get up to speed with this Quick-Start Manual that shows you how to profit in the stock market.
