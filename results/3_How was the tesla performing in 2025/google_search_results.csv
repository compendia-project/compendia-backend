Using data from Inside EVs, Tesla was found to dominate the current market share for EVs in the United States with an approximate market share of 55% while now beginning to feel the heat from new entrants as well as more traditional automakers. The sensitivity analysis takes into account important assumptions with regard to growth in revenues, employees’ remuneration, COGS, and capital outlay. The key variables like market growth within new areas, progress in the area of autonomous vehicles, and change in incentive policies contribute a great deal to the financial performance of Tesla. However, due to higher costs of raw materials and changing regulations affecting the profit margin within the next five years, those projections are expected to be revised upward due to high car sales and subscription software services, which are expected to have a revenue growth rate of about 30% as of the financial year ending in 2028. The research also identifies opportunities and threats such as economic instability, supply chain risks, and increasing competition. In the long run, it will be the capacity of Tesla to overcome these challenges and seize opportunities for the constant development of the automotive industry.', 'Tesla, Financial Analysis, Valuation', '1.Introduction', ""Tesla, Inc. is a pioneering force in the automotive industry, primarily focused on accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy through innovative electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and integrated renewable energy solutions.

The company's revenue streams are diversified across electric vehicle sales, energy generation and storage products, and various services, resulting in significant profit margins. However, Tesla faces increasing pressure from both established automakers and emerging companies, particularly in China, where competition is intensifying rapidly."", 'In 2024, Tesla has been navigating a challenging landscape characterized by shifting consumer preferences and regulatory changes. Notably, the company announced its expansion plans into several international markets, aiming to enhance its manufacturing capabilities and meet the surging global demand for EVs. Additionally, Tesla has been investing heavily in research and development to improve battery technology and autonomous driving features, which are critical for maintaining its competitive edge.', ""Moreover, Tesla's stock performance has reflected investor sentiment amid these market dynamics. Recent earnings reports indicate fluctuations in profit margins due to increased raw material costs and supply chain disruptions, challenges that have impacted the broader automotive sector. In response, Tesla continues to explore strategic partnerships and innovative solutions to mitigate these issues and sustain its growth trajectory."", '2.Forecast Assumptions', 'The financial forecast for Tesla from 2024 to 2028 is based on several critical assumptions. These assumptions are derived from market trends, Tesla’s historical performance, and strategic initiatives aimed at maintaining its competitive edge in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. By analyzing revenue growth, employee compensation, cost of goods sold (COGS), capital expenditures, and other key financial metrics, it provides a detailed projection of Tesla’s financial trajectory over the next five years.', '2.1.Revenue Growth', 'Tesla’s revenue growth is expected to be influenced by several key factors over the next five years:', 'Market Expansion: Tesla plans to expand its presence in both developed and emerging markets, including India and Southeast Asia, where electric vehicle adoption remains low but has significant potential for growth. The increasing global demand for EVs, driven by government policies promoting clean energy, will contribute to Tesla’s revenue growth. However, entry into new markets comes with its own challenges, such as infrastructure readiness and local competition. For instance, the lack of EV charging infrastructure in some regions may slow down Tesla’s initial growth in these markets [1].', 'Autonomous Driving and Software Services: Tesla’s continued investment in autonomous driving and software development is expected to yield high-margin revenue streams. The Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature, which Tesla offers as a subscription service, is likely to play a crucial role in driving future profitability. As Tesla refines its AI and autonomous driving capabilities, consumer adoption of these software services is projected to increase significantly from 2025 onward [2]. This shift towards a software-driven business model will help Tesla maintain a competitive edge in the automotive industry and generate recurring revenue.', 'Competition: While Tesla has been the dominant player in the U.S. EV market, its market share is expected to decline slightly in the coming years due to increased competition. Traditional automakers, such as General Motors and Volkswagen, are ramping up their EV production, while Chinese manufacturers like NIO and XPeng are aggressively expanding into global markets [3, 4]. The influx of new EV models at competitive price points will exert pressure on Tesla’s revenue growth, particularly in price-sensitive regions.', 'Government Incentives and Policies: Government policies, particularly in North America and Europe, have played a critical role in accelerating EV adoption. However, as these subsidies are gradually phased out in key markets, Tesla’s revenue growth may be impacted. The reduction in tax credits and other incentives for EV buyers in the U.S., for example, could slow demand in the short term. Nevertheless, regulatory measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions are likely to sustain the overall demand for EVs [5].', 'Given these factors, Tesla’s revenue growth is expected to slow slightly between 2024 and 2025, with recovery anticipated in 2026 as new markets mature and software services contribute more significantly to overall revenue. By 2028, Tesla is projected to achieve a revenue growth rate of approximately 30%, driven by increased vehicle sales and subscription-based software services [6].', '2.2.Salaries and Benefits', 'Tesla’s employee-related costs are anticipated to rise over the forecast period for several reasons:', 'Gigafactory Expansion: Tesla’s global Gigafactory network expansion is a key factor in driving up salaries and benefits. The company is building new factories in the U.S., Europe, and China to meet the growing demand for EVs and energy storage products. As these factories become operational, Tesla will need to hire a significant number of employees, including manufacturing workers, engineers, and R&D staff [6]. This workforce expansion will contribute to higher salaries and benefits, with Tesla’s total salary expenses expected to rise by approximately 22% to 25% over the next five years.', 'Performance-Based Incentives: Tesla has long used performance-based compensation, including stock options and cash bonuses, to attract and retain top talent in the highly competitive EV and tech industries [7]. As Tesla continues to expand and innovate, the use of these incentives will increase, pushing employee compensation costs upward. Additionally, as Tesla’s stock price remains volatile, employees may expect larger incentive packages to offset potential market risks.', 'Regulatory Changes: Changes in labor laws, particularly in key markets like California and Europe, are expected to increase Tesla’s compensation costs. For example, California’s new regulations on employee benefits and minimum wages will likely raise labor costs in the state [8]. Similarly, Europe’s Green Deal could impose additional regulatory burdens that require Tesla to offer more comprehensive employee benefits.', 'Given these dynamics, Tesla’s total salary expenses are expected to exceed $13 billion by 2028 [6].', '2.3.Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)', 'Several factors are expected to impact Tesla’s COGS over the forecast period:', 'Rising Raw Material Costs: The cost of raw materials, particularly lithium and nickel, is expected to rise over the next few years due to increased global demand for EV batteries. These materials are critical for Tesla’s battery production, and securing long-term contracts will be essential to stabilize costs [1]. However, fluctuations in commodity prices could still impact Tesla’s production costs, especially in the short term.', 'Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain disruptions, such as the ongoing semiconductor shortage, have had a significant impact on the automotive industry, including Tesla [8]. While Tesla has made efforts to mitigate these risks by diversifying its supplier base and developing in-house components, the volatility in the supply chain is expected to continue affecting production costs. Transportation costs, driven by rising fuel prices and logistical challenges, are also expected to contribute to higher COGS.', 'Government Subsidies: Tesla has historically benefited from government subsidies, particularly in North America and Europe. However, as these subsidies are phased out, Tesla will face additional cost pressures. The reduction or elimination of EV subsidies in key markets, such as the U.S., will likely increase Tesla’s production costs, as the company may need to absorb some of the cost increases to maintain competitive pricing [5].', 'Despite these challenges, Tesla is expected to improve production efficiency through continued investment in automation and Gigafactory expansion. As Tesla scales production and secures long-term supply contracts, COGS is projected to stabilize by 2026 [6].', '2.4.Capital Expenditure', 'Tesla’s capital expenditure (CapEx) is projected to remain high over the forecast period due to several key initiatives:', 'Gigafactory Construction: Tesla’s aggressive expansion strategy includes the construction of new Gigafactories in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. These factories are essential for meeting the growing global demand for EVs and energy products. Tesla’s CapEx is expected to peak between 2024 and 2026 as it invests heavily in new production facilities [6]. By increasing its production capacity, Tesla aims to reduce production costs and improve supply chain efficiency.', 'Battery Technology: Tesla’s focus on manufacturing its own batteries is a critical component of its long-term strategy. By producing its own batteries, Tesla can reduce dependence on external suppliers and improve profitability. This initiative will require substantial investment in R&D and manufacturing capabilities, but it is expected to yield long-term benefits by lowering production costs and improving vehicle range and performance [2].', 'Autonomous Driving and AI: Tesla’s continued investment in autonomous driving technology and AI will also drive CapEx. Developing the Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature requires significant R&D investment, and Tesla is expected to increase its spending in this area over the next five years. The successful commercialization of FSD will not only generate high-margin revenue but also strengthen Tesla’s competitive position in the EV market [2].', 'Based on these assumptions, Tesla’s CapEx is projected to reach $10 billion in 2024 and 2025 before decreasing slightly as Tesla recovers from its initial investment phase. By 2028, Tesla’s capital expenditure will stabilize, allowing it to maintain its growth trajectory while improving financial efficiency [6].', '3.Forecast Results', 'Based on the assumptions discussed, Tesla’s financial outlook from 2024 to 2028 reflects a period of both challenges and opportunities. The results highlight Tesla’s projected revenue growth, operating expenses, and key financial metrics, providing a comprehensive picture of the company’s performance trajectory.', 'Tesla’s revenue is forecasted to grow steadily throughout the 2024-2028 period, but the pace of growth will vary. Between 2024 and 2025, revenue growth is expected to slow due to increased competition and the gradual reduction of government subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs). Tesla’s reliance on traditional markets, such as North America and Europe, may limit growth in the short term as these regions approach market saturation [5].', 'However, starting in 2026, Tesla is expected to experience stronger revenue growth, driven by its expansion into emerging markets like Southeast Asia and India, where EV adoption remains low but has significant growth potential [1]. By leveraging its established brand and the introduction of new, more affordable models, Tesla can capture market share in these regions. Additionally, the continued development and commercialization of Tesla’s autonomous driving software and Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscriptions will generate high-margin recurring revenue, further boosting overall sales.', 'By 2028, Tesla’s annual revenue is projected to grow at a rate of approximately 30%, supported by increased vehicle sales, growth in emerging markets, and the expansion of software-based services [2]. The shift toward a software-driven business model is expected to significantly improve Tesla’s profit margins, with subscription-based services providing a more consistent revenue stream.', 'Tesla’s employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits, will increase significantly over the forecast period. As Tesla continues to expand its Gigafactory network and scale its operations globally, the demand for skilled labor will rise, leading to higher compensation costs [6]. Additionally, regulatory changes in key markets, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, will impose further upward pressure on labor costs.', 'Tesla’s use of performance-based incentives, such as stock options and bonuses, will remain a key component of its compensation strategy [7]. While these incentives are effective for retaining top talent, they will significantly increase total employee compensation over the next five years. By 2028, Tesla’s total salary expenses are expected to exceed $13 billion, reflecting the growing scale of its workforce and the competitive nature of the EV and technology industries.', 'Tesla’s COGS is projected to remain high throughout the forecast period due to rising raw material costs and continued supply chain disruptions. Lithium, nickel, and other key materials for battery production are expected to see price increases, putting pressure on Tesla’s production costs [1]. Supply chain volatility, particularly in the semiconductor industry, will also impact COGS, though Tesla’s investments in automation and production efficiency should help mitigate some of these cost increases.', 'By 2026, as Tesla expands its production capacity and secures long-term contracts with suppliers, COGS is expected to stabilize. The introduction of new production technologies and vertical integration into battery manufacturing will help Tesla reduce its dependence on external suppliers, lowering production costs in the long run [8].', 'Tesla’s capital expenditure (CapEx) will peak between 2024 and 2026, driven by the construction of new Gigafactories and continued investment in research and development (R&D). Tesla’s ambitious expansion plans, particularly in Asia and Europe, will require substantial upfront investment, but these projects are expected to yield long-term benefits in terms of increased production capacity and reduced operational costs [6].', 'After 2026, Tesla’s CapEx is expected to decline slightly as its new facilities become operational and its R&D investments begin to pay off. By 2028, Tesla’s CapEx will stabilize, allowing the company to focus on maintaining operational efficiency while continuing to innovate in areas such as autonomous driving and energy storage technologies [2].', '4.Risks', 'Tesla’s growth over the next five years is accompanied by several risks that could impact its financial performance. These risks stem from economic uncertainties, intensifying competition, supply chain challenges, and regulatory changes. Addressing these risks will be crucial for Tesla to maintain its leadership in the electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy markets.', 'Global economic conditions present a significant risk to Tesla’s future growth. Inflation, potential recessions, and rising interest rates could dampen consumer demand for electric vehicles, particularly in emerging markets. In regions like Southeast Asia and India, where Tesla is planning to expand, economic instability could delay EV adoption as consumers prioritize affordability over sustainability (Bloomberg Intelligence, 2023). Additionally, rising interest rates could increase Tesla’s borrowing costs, making it more expensive to fund expansion projects, such as new Gigafactories, and invest in research and development (R&D) [6].', 'A potential global economic downturn could also impact Tesla’s ability to generate consistent revenue from its software services, such as Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscriptions. In an economic crisis, consumers may be less willing to pay for premium features, which could reduce Tesla’s high-margin software revenue [2].', 'The electric vehicle market is becoming increasingly competitive, with both established automakers and new entrants aggressively investing in EV technologies. Chinese manufacturers like NIO, XPeng, and BYD have gained significant market share in China and are expanding into Europe and other global markets [9]. Traditional automakers, such as General Motors, Ford, and Volkswagen, are also transitioning to EV production at scale, leveraging their existing customer bases and manufacturing expertise to challenge Tesla’s market dominance [10].', 'Tesla’s response to these competitive pressures will be critical in maintaining its market position. Pricing competition may force Tesla to lower its prices, which could impact its margins. Moreover, competitors’ focus on affordability, particularly in emerging markets, poses a risk to Tesla’s ability to grow in these regions.', 'Supply chain disruptions remain a significant risk for Tesla, particularly in the semiconductor industry. Global shortages of semiconductors, combined with rising transportation costs and logistical challenges, could delay Tesla’s production and increase its costs [8]. Although Tesla has taken steps to mitigate these risks by diversifying its supply base and investing in vertical integration, the volatility of global supply chains poses an ongoing challenge.', 'Regulatory changes, particularly in key markets like the United States and Europe, could impact Tesla’s operations. Governments are increasingly implementing stricter emissions standards and labor regulations, which may increase Tesla’s production costs [8]. For example, the European Union’s Green Deal aims to make the region carbon-neutral by 2050, which will require automakers to invest heavily in sustainable production practices. Tesla’s compliance with these regulations could lead to higher operating expenses [4].', 'Furthermore, changes in labor laws, such as rising minimum wage standards and stricter employee benefits regulations in states like California, will increase Tesla’s labor costs [7]. These regulatory pressures may reduce Tesla’s profit margins and complicate its expansion plans. In conclusion, Tesla is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory over the next five years, thanks to its leadership in electric vehicle (EV) technology, its innovative approach to software and autonomous driving, and its aggressive expansion into new markets. The company’s ability to capitalize on emerging trends, such as the shift towards software-driven revenue streams and the rising demand for sustainable energy solutions, will be key to its success. Tesla’s investments in expanding its Gigafactory network and vertical integration in battery production are expected to improve operational efficiency and reduce long-term costs [6].', '5.Conclusion', 'In conclusion, Tesla is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory over the next five years, thanks to its leadership in electric vehicle (EV) technology, its innovative approach to software and autonomous driving, and its aggressive expansion into new markets. The company’s ability to capitalize on emerging trends, such as the shift towards software-driven revenue streams and the rising demand for sustainable energy solutions, will be key to its success. Tesla’s investments in expanding its Gigafactory network and vertical integration in battery production are expected to improve operational efficiency and reduce long-term costs.', 'However, Tesla also faces significant risks that could hinder its growth.

The gain almost offset the dollar-value decline in Tesla's automotive sales in the same period."", 'New vehicle models and updates support Tesla’s growth plans. The latest major product initiative was the 2023 Cybertruck launch. In 2025, Tesla plans to produce a cheaper car model and launch test markets for its robotaxi services. Investors are awaiting updates on both projects.', ""The Cybertruck launch has been disappointing relative to Musk's early predictions. He had projected to sell250,000 to 500,000electric trucks annually. According to Kelley Blue Book, quoted by Benzinga, Tesla sold fewer than40,000Cybertrucks in 2024. Worse, third-party data fromCox Automotiveindicates that Cybertruck sales have declined in 2025 relative to last year."", ""Teslauses AIin its business and products. AI enables manufacturing cost efficiencies and underpins Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) technology. The evolution of unsupervised FSD will be critical for the company's robotaxi initiative."", 'China is Tesla’s second-largest market after the U.S., accounting for an estimated36%of sales. Tesla often does not break out sales figures by country, but the China Passenger Car Association tracks and reports vehicle unit sales by manufacturer. According to the China Internet Information Center, Tesla sold 137,200 units in the first quarter, up about 3% from the prior year.', 'Tesla has been facing heavy competition from Chinese EV and hybrid manufacturer BYD. BYD recently launched a lower-priced EV to compete with the Tesla Model 3, long a top seller in China.', 'Macroeconomic factors affecting Tesla include:', 'According toYahoo Finance, analysts expect Tesla to report first-quarter revenue of $21.81 billion and EPS of $0.43 per share. These numbers compare to revenue of $21.3 billion and EPS of $0.45 in last year’s first quarter.', 'Tesla has missed revenue and earnings expectations in five of the last seven quarters.', 'Tesla’s stock price has improved slightly since April 9, when Trump paused many reciprocal tariffs. However, the S&P 500 large-cap index showed the same trend, indicating general sentiment improvement rather than a Tesla-specific change.', 'Bottom Line', ""Tesla is flirting with a crisis as EV demand falters and Musk's cost-cutting actions within the U.S. government spark anger among consumers. The upcoming first-quarter earnings release will likely show flat-to-negative performance. Longer-term, Tesla could realize growth from its promised cheaper car model, unsupervised FSD and robotaxis—so investors this quarter should watch closely for signs of progress on these initiatives.""]","data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABwAAAAcCAMAAABF0y+mAAAAZlBMVEUYFxYQDg0GBAALCggVFBNTUlF0dHRqamlubm5mZmYdHBu+vr3////v7+/s7Ow1NTQSERAAAACUlJRBQD/MzMz19fRPT048OzsiISDV1NTq6uovLi2ioaHg4OAtLCsoJiVHRkWMjItuM4hgAAAAyUlEQVR4AcXQBRKDMBBA0YQYThZ3uf8lu6nvkPHKx3lo2FfjwXtCElPauEIMN1H8jiJKUleW55nbFpYolM4qAKHqtEEk2iLmHWcS+qHpKPIKnzde74CoqSjabkScLJNC9nMhKRYL4mrlpmN0RnFyuAnQdY9Ek9uA2FbRUsdn7BHTYchSRP+d3bYPFN/euXIw9J1vX1tY2d8GlsTdf+YVZ5Kf7DZCWSuYL6HwY5sIvAZzis0QeEwPSNhw2BPKYq+u7ZVkZ+X3LPtzF3mnDlewk4KhAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC",Forbes,www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com › Money,['Tesla stock is down 38% in 2025'],1

The interior's still a bit sparse for my tastes, and I'd love the option of a head-up display. But it's still looking like a great all-rounder.”"", 'Driven and reviewed by', 'Vicky Parrott', '\u200b', ""The Tesla Model Y. You don’t really need me to tell you about it, do you? After all, it was the best selling electric car in the UK and across the whole world, in 2024. Oh, and in 2023. And yup, you guessed it – in 2022, too. So, this new one? It's pretty big news."", ""This new 2025 Tesla Model Y isn't an all-new car; it's a facelift, so we’re talking about the same platform as the'old' Model Y, but with a sleek new look inspired by the Cybertruck and Cybercab. It’s also more aerodynamic, has a stiffer body shell to improve handling and comfort, and it’s said to be quieter and more comfortable on the move."", 'The Model Y remains much the same size, and at 4.79-metres long it’s still a rival for a huge array of other electric SUVs, ranging from premium stuff like thePorsche MacanandAudi Q6 e-tronthrough to more affordable alternatives like theFord Mustang Mach-E, BYD Sealion 7, Peugeot E-3008,Skoda Enyaq,Kia EV6,Renault Scenic E-Techand Toyota bZ4X.', 'For this 2025 Model Y, Tesla has given it a new fascia with a lower front splitter and a sleek, full-width headlight that’s a bit reminiscent of theCybertruckor Robotaxi. Or of Cyclops from X-Men, if you ask me. You get the gist – it’s all very futuristic and minimalist, and I actually rather like it. It’s also key to the improved aerodynamics that have allowed Tesla to squeeze an extra 20 miles or so out of the official range figures, making this one of the longest range electric SUVs you can buy.', ""The back of the Model Y looks cool, too. I really love the way the new light strip is hidden, and reflects onto the bodywork so that you get a sort of ‘ambient’ look to it. It's a bit different to the straightforward LED lightstrips that have become a bit ubiquitous on a lot of modern cars."", ""The Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive\xa0has an official WLTP range of 311 miles, and a 0-60mph time of 5.6 seconds. The Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive\xa0has up to 387 miles of WLTP range and a 0-60mph of 5.4 seconds, with the Long Range All-Wheel Drive\xa0offering 364 miles of range (WLTP)\xa0and a 0-60mph time of 4.6 seconds. The Performance model is almost inevitable, but details haven't yet been confirmed."", '“Tesla doesn’t state battery capacities.” So said the nice man from Tesla when I asked him about the Model Y, and I can’t say I was surprised. I’ve been asking Tesla representatives about battery specifics for a decade now, and have always had the same response. Never mind. It’s annoying, especially as the details inevitably find their way onto the internet via the ever-enthusiastic Tesla owners clubs, anyway, but it’s safe to say that the Tesla Model Y has retained its 75kWh lithium-ion NMC battery and has made range gains through aerodynamic improvements.', 'Rapid charging speeds peak at 250kW, which is nothing new for the Model Y, but still makes this one of the fastest-charging electric family cars. It’s up there with the Porsche Macan, Audi Q6 e-tron and Kia EV6 for that, and will manage a 10-80% top-up in well under 30 minutes.', 'Obviously, being a Tesla, you have access to the Tesla Supercharger network. Let’s face it - this remains a benchmark for cost and reliability when it comes to public rapid charging, and is still a big incentive for high mileage drivers.', 'Considering a used Tesla? Check out the secondhand cars for sale on Electrifying.com', 'You do lose 20-litres of space in the 2025 Tesla Model Y’s boot, as a result of the new, electrically-folding rear seats, but the boot space is still pretty huge with a total load capacity of 2,138 litres including the frunk. More than that, the rear seats now fold flat electrically and the bootlid is powered, too. There’s also a funky, magnetic loadbay cover that you can fold up and back, and that can also be stowed away in a dedicated cubby under the boot floor. Speaking as a dog owner, this sort of stuff is a lifesaver when you want to get the dog in the boot, but don’t want to leave the loadbay cover behind.', 'Up front in the cabin, there’s some big news… And it comes in the form of the indicator stalk. This is controversial, because the ‘Highlander’2024 Model 3became infamous for the indicator buttons on the steering wheel, which replaced its indicator stalk, and which many of us really didn’t get along with. Not least, our illustrious leader, Ginny(you can check out her opinion, here).', 'Tesla won’t confirm that it’s chosen to keep an indicator stalk on the Model Y because, well, there was a lot of hate for the indicator buttons on the 3. But it seems logical that that’s why the Y has a ‘precision engineered’ stalk. Anyway, regardless of why it’s there, we’re very pleased that it is.', 'The rest of the interior is improved with better material finish and ambient lighting, while the glass also reflects 26% more of the sunlight to keep the interior cool in the summer and reduce glare.', 'As ever with the Y, space isn’t a problem and even a tall adult will be alright in the back despite that swoopy roofline.', ""One last thing to know: the seven-seat Tesla Model Y that only arrived last year (after a very, very long wait)? That's not confirmed for this facelift, yet. And they've sold out of the ones that did get brought into the UK. So if you want a seven-seat Model Y, you're out of luckunless you want to buy used. And even then, there aren't many out there."", 'The 15.4-inch touchscreen stays much the same, and is still your portal to all of the car’s inner workings and functions, but obviously with Tesla’s over-the-air software updates it’ll always have the latest software. Still no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, but it’s a good system regardless.', 'Tech upgrades include improved wi-fi hotspot that’s now got greater range and faster download speeds. The phone key performance has also improved thanks to the addition of ‘ultra wideband’. Nope, I don’t know what that is, either, but it means that - if you set your phone up so that it functions as your car key for keyless entry and drive – the car will now sense your phone more reliably and from a bit further away.', ""Other improvements include redesigned seats, which are usefully comfier than the seats you got in the pre-facelift Model Y. There's more side support in the front seats, and longer seat squabs in the back, and they feel a bit softer to me. Just nicer all round, really."", 'The trademark huge panoramic glass roof is still standard, too, which makes the whole thing feel nice and airy.\xa0You also get an 8.0-inch colour screen in the back, now, which controls the climate control in the back, or you can do some gaming on it.', 'Overall, the improved materials and new ambient lighting have lifted the feel of the Model Y’s interior so that it now feels noticeably classier, even if Porsche, BMW and Audi don’t need to worry about Tesla bettering their cabin quality any time soon.', 'I spent a few days running around in the Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD (the Launch Edition, to be specific), and it is a noticeable improvement on the older Model Y. It’s still not the comfiest in terms of ride comfort; there’s noticeable thumps and jarring over patched up town roads, although it settles much better at higher speeds than the pre-facelift Model Y.', 'A new steering wheel is another improvement; it’s a bit slimmer and looks nicer, which only helps you to enjoy the fairly quick but well-weighted steering. It really does feel quite sporty, the Model Y. Not in quite the engaging, sports-SUV way that the Macan does, but it turns nicely into corners and generally feels keyed in. Just a bit sharper and more assertive than the Skoda Enyaq, really, although the Skoda’s the better bet if you want a soft, cushy ride.', 'Refinement is okay in the Tesla; again, it’s improved but it’s still not the best in class. There’s a bit of wind noise, albeit nothing that’s going to really bother you, and tyre noise is quite noticeable off the 20-inch Michelin tyres that were fitted to our test car.', 'Performance? I mean, yeah, it’s got that. The AWD Long Range manages 0-60mph in 4.6 seconds, so it’s not short of acceleration when you want it, and you can really shock your kids if you want to.', 'As with the Model 3, the Model Y only has one, heavy brake regen’ setting that means you drive around almost all of the time just using the accelerator pedal – you barely need to use the brake pedal at all, although it’s got perfectly decent feel and response when you do.', 'Generally, it’s a slick and impressive drive, the Model Y. A Kia EV6 is a bit sharper and more fun to drive (if a lot smaller inside), and the Enyaq is comfier yet misses out on the convenience and lower costs of the Tesla Supercharger network.', ""Orders are open now and deliveries begin in May this year for the 'Juniper' Tesla Model Y AWD Long Range Launch Edition, but at £60,995 it's surprisingly expensive and we'd say you're better off waiting a few weeks longer to get hold of one of the standard models."", ""The\xa0Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive starts from £48,990, while the Long Range All-Wheel Drive starting from £51,990, which is actually some £1,000 cheaper than previously! Either of these are great value, as is the-entry level Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive that starts at\xa0\xa0£44,990. Deliveries of these rather better value models are due to start in early summer 2025, so there's not too long to wait."", ""All new Model Y vehicles include front and rear lightbars, acoustic glass, an 8-inch rear touchscreen, powered boot opening, customisable ambient lighting, and an additional front facing camera. The Launch Edition does get some upgraded features including ventilated front seats, some exclusive badging and kick-plate design, but it's really not worth the extra money, if you ask me."", 'Enhanced Autopilot, which includes semi-autonomous lane-changes and motorway slip-road control (on top of the standard adaptive cruise control) is a £3,800 option on every Model Y.', ""'Full Self-Driving Capability' includes traffic light- and stop-sign recognition, and will also be updated automatically as Tesla introduces more upgrades in future. Mind you, it costs £6,800 and we can't stress enough that it is not - I repeat, NOT - an actual self-driving mode. It is probably the best and most advanced semi-autonomous driving system on sale. But even with it fitted, a Tesla will not drive itself. And it's not going to drive itself any time soon. So don't be fooled by the very misleading 'full self-driving' name. Rant over..."", 'Obviously, the final decision for most potential Model Y buyers will come down to monthly finance costs, which start from £399 for the entry level car, £449 per month for the Long Range RWD and £499 for the Long Range AWD, assuming a deposit of £6,000 and a contract of 48 months.', 'Those are some very competitive monthly deals, but if you want to grab a real bargainthen you can always check out our weekly deals page, which is updated every week with the very best electric car deals every week.', 'Overall, the new 2025 Tesla Model Y feels like more of the same – but better. We like all of the updates, including the style stuff, and the comfier seats and prospect of better ride comfort and refinement definitely sound good to us. It’s great to drive, and now more comfortable as well – which was always our main issue previously.', 'The price of the Launch Edition is, frankly, a bit too much.

'The newest Model Y looks very different from its predecessor. Photo: HWZ', 'Is it possible to write a review of any Tesla without mentioning its CEO Elon Musk? For better or worse, the company is synonymous—symbiotic, even—with Musk. After all,profits plummeted 71%amidst Musk’s involvement with the Trump administration. But even if you disagree with his views and his activities in American politics, it’s hard not to be impressed with what Tesla has achieved and its products. The company’s Model Y wasn’t just the best-selling EV in the world, it was the best-selling car in the world. Clearly, it’s no chump.', ""The TL;DR version:As a transportation device, the new Model Y is extremely capable. It's practical, comfortable, and priced reasonably."", 'It’s easy to mistakethe new Model Yas being an entirely new model because it looks so different to the one it replaces. But it’s actually a facelift, not a brand-new model. However, as far as facelifts go, the changes are extensive. I’ve written about the updates extensively inmy first impressions piece,and my colleague has coveredthe differences between the new and old Model Y hereso I would bore you with the details, but after having spent the past weekend with the latest Model Y, I’d say the updates are largely successful.', 'The styling changes are supposed to improve aerodynamics and add attractiveness. Tesla claims the drag coefficient has been reduced by about 5%, but this is hard to prove without access to a wind tunnel. What I can say, however, is that it looks contemporary. The entire front fascia is a lot sleeker and I think many will like the new full-width light bar that serves as daytime running lights. Though light bars are all the rage now, I worry that it’ll age the car poorly in a couple of years. Only time will tell.', ""The rear lightbar casts a soft glow and looks really nice when it's dark. Photo: HWZ"", 'The interior has also been updated to match the new Model 3. Rear passengers now have a screen for climate and media controls. Kids will love that it can also be used to watch YouTube and play games. And because there’s ample legroom, the rear is generally a pleasant place to sit in.', 'The other interior highlight is themassive panoramic glass roof. It stretches across the entire length of the car and gives the interior an incredible sense of airiness. It lets a lot of light in so it’s a good thing it’s silver-coated to insulate against heat. The coating does a good enough job as long as you have the air-con running. Park the Model Y outside on a sunny day and the interior will get as hot as a sauna. In these instances, you’ll want to use the app to pre-cool the car before getting into it.', 'Rear legroom is good for a car of its size. Photo: HWZ', 'Drivers will appreciatethe return of the indicator stalk. This makes signalling so much more intuitive. There’s still no stalk for the wiper controls and high beam—you’ll need to use buttons on the steering wheel for that—and unless you spend a lot of time in a Ferrari, this will take some getting used to.', 'I know readers want me to compare the ride of the new Model Yagainst its predecessor, but the fact is it’s been nearly three years since I drove the old Model Y so I don’t think I can make a fair comparison.', 'The driver environment is as bare as ever. Note, the return of the indicator stalk. Photo: HWZ', ""What I can say, however, is that the new car rides well. Tesla said it has improved the car’s suspension and it shows.It soaks up undulations without fuss, but body movement remains well-controlled. Therefore, passengers never feel like they are in a boat on choppy waters being tossed around. Even on poorly paved roads it remains relatively composed. Not many SUVs in its price bracket can manage this trick. But it's not omnipotent, it pitches quite severely if you approach humps at an angle."", 'Another contributing factor to the new car’s improved ride comfort is the ability to reduce the strength of its regenerative braking. I’ve always felt that the default level was too strong, so this feature is a godsend. Turning it down to the new Reduced setting enables the new Model Y to feel more like a traditional car and coast whenever you take your foot off the throttle.', 'The front lightbar and headlights give the new Model Y is sleeker looking frontend. Photo: HWZ', 'Tesla claims it doesn’t affect range, but during my time with the car, I found that using it in the Reduced settingincreased power consumption by around 3kW/100km. In other words, reducing the brake regeneration could mean a range reduction of around 20%. That’s not an insignificant amount, which means the more prudent thing to do would be to acclimatise to the heavy brake regeneration—the sooner, the better. In fact, considering how imprecise the brake pedal feels, it’s arguably better to get used to the default brake regeneration to slow the car down.', 'It’s quiet too. Like the facelifted Model 3, the new Model Y gets double-glazed glass throughout and more sound-deadening materials throughout the car. Tesla claims these changesreduce cabin noise by 20%and I can believe that. The serenity within the new Model Y is remarkable, even by electric car standards.', 'The boot is huge and has a capacity of 854L. If you hold the rear seats down, it increases the capacity to a whopping 2,138L. Photo: HWZ', 'The Model Y I tested was the Rear-Wheel Drive 110. Despite being the least powerful model in the lineup, it still felt quite brisk. Power output might just be110kW (148hp), but the car has a rather sizeable 350nm of torque. Plant your foot to the carpet and you will feel that instantaneous surge of power that only EVs can deliver. Tesla claims 0 to 100km/h in 9.6 seconds, but it genuinely feels quicker. It’s only at around highway speeds that it starts to run out of breath.', 'Power consumption duringmy test drive of over 350km was 14.6kW/100km. Given that the Model Y has a battery capacity of around 60kWh, one could get around 250km of range if you wanted to keep your battery between 20% and 80% charge. For longer trips where you’d charge the battery fully, you could probably cover 400km before needing to plug it into a charger. These figures are all very decent for a car of its type.', 'The new Model Y is a sensible update and is one of the most practical cars in its class. Photo: HWZ', 'Tesla may not be making headlines for the right reasons now, but its ability to make objectively good electric cars is possibly irrefutable. And on the whole, this new Model Y is a more competent car than its predecessor. Yes, there are cheaper Chinese alternatives, but none matches the Model Y’s levels of refinement. If you buy a car solely for getting around and transporting people and things, few can do it as well as the new Model Y.', 'The new Tesla Model Y is available now in three variants and prices start atS$76,090.The table below shows the prices, road taxes, and estimated on-road prices of the three variants.', ""You can order the new Model Y on Tesla's website here.""]","data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABwAAAAcCAMAAABF0y+mAAAAaVBMVEX////0+e7f7s7U6L7j8NX7/fjR57mUyU5/vxyDwSeEwSmBwCGdzWDv9uaPxkSKxDqFwi6MxT54vADo89yCwCTC36HM5LGHwzL8/vqx1oS93Jmn0XO625TE4KTr9OG42pCs1Hzc7Mmiz2k2monOAAABAklEQVR4AWKgOQCwRRYIDMIwAAzepttSZmGG/f+RS3A7nGsMgjCK4uRQpZmxaJ05RTt1vlgi7yjLzTWP1+7miOj+CDT5k6+PpUtQXK4KCjle1zfMvDyRO2vhi8HPGb7XuXBipJ4u/skNsQnh5IqpUZSCpaQUp7iknBNXTKRL43sv8QcZjrJWOfYscA2Vicd+eOiHevwXHuY5yIeXF/rQ9EVNCZUbZw21Vg5C5KxHk4LU/MGA73MJRfR7Brocp0l/KNb95sEldTA9kXKvk+FL58wnmCiNWnZ1GobPVh6mSWDuk9FaZElSrX8ae5owL9jwdchq2HIEO4q0zhEvdQT/DSQAACXZEfzMKp0qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC",HardwareZone,www.hardwarezone.com.sg,https://www.hardwarezone.com.sg › Lifestyle › Cars,['Tesla 2025 Model Y RWD 110 review'],4

China maintained its lead among major markets, with electric car sales exceeding 11\xa0million – more than were sold worldwide just 2 years earlier. Global sales were slightly tempered by stagnating growth in Europe, as subsidies were phased out or reduced in several major markets, and as the EU CO2targets for cars remained the same between 2023 and 2024. Electric car sales continued to increase in the United\xa0States although growth was about one-quarter that of the previous year. Significantly, outside of these three major markets, there was a record increase in sales of nearly 40% to reach 1.3\xa0million, closing in on the United\xa0States’ sales of 1.6\xa0million electric cars.', 'The rapid growth in electric car sales over the past 5 years has had a significant impact on the global car fleet: At the end of 2024, the electric car fleet had reached almost 58\xa0million, about 4% of the total passenger car fleet and more than triple the total electric car fleet in 2021. Notably, the global stock ofelectric cars displacedover 1\xa0million barrels per day of oil consumption in 2024. Of course, the stock of electric cars is not spread evenly across the world – in China, for example, around one in ten cars on the road is now electric, whereas in Europe the ratio is closer to one in twenty.', 'Almost half of China’s car sales were electric in 2024, representing almost two-thirds of electric cars sold globally', 'Electric car sales in China increased by almost 40% year-on-year in 2024, further driving up China’s share of global electric car sales. In 2021, China accounted for half of global electric car sales; this share grew to almost two-thirds in 2024. On a monthly basis, sales of electric cars have overtaken conventional car sales in the country since July 2024, bringing the share of electric car sales close to 50% for the full year. In China, 2024 marks the fourth consecutive year in which the electric car sales share grew by approximately 10 percentage points year-on-year.', 'The growth in China reflects in no small part thegrowing price competitivenessof battery electric cars with conventional cars in the country. In addition, China’s electric car market benefitted from the introduction of atrade-in schemein April 2024. The scheme, which is part of a wider economic stimulus package, applies to the purchase of conventional and electric cars alike, but with different levels of financial support. It offers CNY\xa020\xa0000 (Yuan renminbi) (USD\xa02\xa0750) for consumers that replace an older vehicle (conventional or electric) with a new electric car, and CNY\xa015\xa0000 (USD\xa02\xa0050) for replacement with a new conventional vehicle. In 2024, about6.6\xa0millionconsumers applied for the incentive, 60% of whom bought an electric car. As such, more than one-third of the over 11\xa0million new electric car sales in the country benefitted from this incentive.', 'In recent years, sales of plug-in hybrid electric cars have been growing faster than sales of battery electric cars in China. The share of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales, excluding extended-range EVs (EREVs)2, in China’s total electric car sales has risen from about 15% in 2020 to nearly 30% in 2024. Meanwhile, the share of EREVs has more than quadrupled since 2020, surpassing 10% in 2024. The acceleration of PHEV sales in China led the share of electric car sales that are battery electric to fall from 80% in 2020 to below 60% in 2024, though in absolute terms battery electric car sales increased sevenfold over the same period, demonstrating their continued appeal to new customers.', 'In Europe, electric car sales stagnated in 2024 as policy support waned in major car markets', 'About one in five new cars sold on the European market was electric in 2024, maintaining the sales share of the previous year. The electric sales share increased in 2024 in 14 out of 27 EU member states, while it either stalled or decreased in the rest, including in several larger markets, such as Germany and France, largely as a result of subsidies being phased out or reduced. InGermany, subsidies ceased at the end of 2023, whileFrancehas progressively reduced its subsidy over the years. At the start of 2024, France limited the amount of environmental bonus available to higher-income car buyers and reduced the number of vehicles eligible for the subsidy.', 'Besides subsidies, the policy design of the European\xa0Union CO2standards may also have held back further growth of the electric car market in 2024. As new targets come into effect every 5 years, car makers hadno incentiveto push sales of electric cars further in 2024 (in anticipation of strengthened targets in 2025). This is in contrast to markets such as the United\xa0Kingdom, where annually increasing targets move original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) towards electrification each year. In March 2025, the European Commission published itsIndustrial Action Planfor the European automotive sector, in which it proposed to amend the CO2emission performance standards for cars and vans, granting them additional flexibilities by averaging their performance over a 3-year period.', 'In the United\xa0Kingdom – the second-largest car market in Europe – electric car sales reached a share of nearly 30%, up from 24% in 2023. The year 2024 was the first under theVehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which required 22% of all new registrations to be BEV or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). When accounting for the scheme’s flexibilities, which allows OEMs to borrow credits from future years, they were able tocomplywith a battery electric car sales share of close to 20%. Norway reached near-total electrification of sales, with88%of car sales being battery electric and just under 3% plug-in hybrid. As a result of the growing stock of electric cars, Norway’s oil consumption for road in 2024 decreased by12%compared to 2021. From April 2025,a tax increaseon conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and PHEVs is expected to further increase the battery electric share towards meeting the Norwegian government’s 2025 goal of 100% zero-emissions car sales. In Denmark, the electric sales share increased by 10 percentage points to reach 56%, with nearly 100\xa0000 electric cars sold.', 'The market share of electric cars continued to expand in the United\xa0States', 'In the United\xa0States, electric car sales increased to 1.6\xa0million in 2024, with the sales share growing to more than 10%. However, growth in electric car sales slowed down significantly in 2024, increasing by just 10% compared to 40% in 2023. In spite of this, electric car sales did boost the overall car market, as sales of conventional cars stagnated.', 'A total of 24 new electric car models were launched in 2024, increasing model availability by 15% compared to 2023, providing consumers with more choices and further increasing competition. While the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 have been the two best-selling models in the United\xa0States since 2020, the 110 new models that have entered the market since then have driven the market share of Tesla down from 60% in 2020 to 38% in 2024. Furthermore, 2024 was the first year in which Tesla saw a drop in sales in the United\xa0States, while other OEMs saw sales increase by 20% on aggregate.', 'A modification to the US Clean Vehicle Tax Credit at the start of 2024 enabled buyers to receive an instant discount (up to USD\xa07\xa0500 for a new electric car and USD\xa04\xa0000 for a used electric car) at the point of sale, which may have served to entice interested buyers. However, not all electric cars were eligible for the credit: in 2024 about 20 electric models (not accounting for different trim levels) out of a total 110 were eligible, which translated to over half of US electric car sales. The real share that benefitted from the tax credit may be even higher. In 2023, provisions were introduced on leased electric cars toreclassifythem as commercial vehicles, thereby making them eligible for the tax credit without having to meet requirements on local manufacturing. As a result, by 2024, nearlyhalfof all EVs sold were leased, more than double the share seen 3 years earlier. In addition to the federal tax credit, in 2024,27 states offered additional incentives, rebates and exemptions promoting electric car adoption.', 'Electric car sales shares doubled in a number of emerging markets', 'In emerging and developing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa, electric car sales increased by over 60% year-on-year in 2024, and the sales share almost doubled from 2.5% to 4%. This rapid growth has been strengthened by policy incentives and the growing presence of relatively affordable electric cars from Chinese OEMs.', 'Emerging and developing economies inAsia(excluding China) saw a large increase in electric car sales, reaching almost 400\xa0000 in 2024, up over 40% from 2023. However, in India, total electric car sales and their share of sales increased only slightly, approaching 100\xa0000 (or 2%) in 2024. Thailand remained the largest EV market in Southeast Asia, despite a 10% drop in electric car sales. This decline was outweighed by an even steeper 26% drop in conventional car sales, largely due tostricter lending criteria, meaning the electric sales share rose to 13% in 2024, up from 11% the previous year. Within the region, Indonesia and Viet\xa0Nam also stood out, respectively tripling and nearly doubling their sales numbers and reaching sales shares comparable to countries such as Spain or Canada. In many Southeast Asian countries, BEVs are the most popular electric car type, with over 90% of all electric car sales being fully electric.', 'InLatin America, sales volumes and penetration rates doubled in many countries, with electric cars reaching a market share of 4% in 2024. Brazil towered over other countries in the region with nearly 125\xa0000 electric car sales, more than twice the number of 2023 sales, and the electric sales share doubled to 6.5%. Costa Rica, Uruguay and Colombia also achieved impressive sales shares of around 15%, 13% and 7.5%, respectively. These increases are in large part the result of governmentincentivessuch as tax exemptions, reduced registration fees, a relaxation of traffic restrictions for EVs, and relatively high fossil fuel prices.', 'InAfrica, electric car sales more than doubled to reach nearly 11\xa0000 in 2024. Sales shares remained low, at under 1%, though there was growth in several countries, such as Morocco and Egypt, where new electric car sales increased to more than 2\xa0000.', 'Emerging electric car brands are seeing local and even international success', 'Recent years have seen the birth of several new electric car brands in emerging markets, such as VinFast in Viet\xa0Nam, Togg in Türkiye, andTitoin Argentina, helping to drive up sales. In Viet\xa0Nam,local brands underpinned the near doubling of the electric sales share in 2024 to reach 17%. VinFast has also started to export to 11 different countries, with the largest share of exports going to Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia (44%) and Malaysia (22%), but also to the United\xa0States (22%).

In addition, at the end of 2023, Indian steelmaker JSW signed a joint venture with SAIC Motor, a Chinese OEM, to work together on car production under the name MG Motor. In 2024, the joint venture produced about half of its electric cars sold in India domestically, while the other half were imported from China. At the end of 2024,JSWalso announced the launch of its own EV brand, and is in talks with partners such as BYD and Geely regardingcollaborationon technology transfer.', 'Overseas expansion plans of Chinese producers, prompted by changes to import tariffs, drove sales in emerging markets', 'Another notable trend from 2024 was the numerous manufacturing announcements from Chinese OEMs in countries such as Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, where temporary exemptions from import tariffs for electric cars are coming to an end. In 2024, electric car sales inBrazilmore than doubled, with over 85% of new electric cars coming from China. A key factor behind this impressive growth was electric cars being exempt from import duties of 35%, though this exemption started to be gradually removed in 2024 and is set to end by the middle of 2026. By then, automakersBYDandGWMwill have begun producing models in Brazil, with a range tailored to the Brazilian market, such as BYD’sSong Pro, which will be flex-fuel compatible.', 'InThailand, Chinese imports play a key role in electrification, accounting for 85% of electric car sales. However, as in Brazil, this share is expected to decline due to changes introduced in theEV 3.5 program, under which import taxes on electric cars will be reintroduced at the end of 2025 and existing subsidies of up to THB\xa0100\xa0000 (Thai baht) (USD\xa02\xa0800) per imported car will be gradually phased out. To continue to qualify for theexemption and subsidy, OEMs must commit to producing at least two battery electric vehicles (BEVs) domestically by the end of 2026 for every imported BEV sold in 2024 and 2025.', 'InIndonesia, electric car sales tripled in 2024 while the conventional market contracted by 20%, leading to an electric sales share of over 7%. The government has supported adoption by reducing the VAT rate on electric cars from 11% to 1% since 2023. However, what has potentially had an evengreater impacton reducing the cost of electric cars for Indonesian buyers – and thus stimulating EV sales – has been the government waivingimport taxesfor EVs from car makers that invest in local electric car manufacturing from the start of 2024. Chinese car manufactures such asBYDandGAC Aionprofited from this reduction, as did European OEMStellantis. As a result, Chinese electric car imports increased 18-fold to 34\xa0000 by the end of 2024.', 'InMalaysia,electric car sales more than doubledin 2024 and the sales share increased from less than 2% in 2023 to nearly 4% in 2024.

More than 70% of all electric cars sold in these two countries were imported from China, with Chinese imports to Colombia more than tripling in 2024, while imports from other countries grew by just 30%. InUzbekistan,electric car sales shares doubled and theaverage price of an imported electric carfell almost threefold between 2023 and 2024.', 'InAfrica,local policies and changing trade regimes are reshaping the electric car market.

Across the full first quarter, the share of electric car sales was similar to that of 2024.', 'In Europe, electric car sales reached more than 900\xa0000 in the first quarter of 2025, 625\xa0000 of which were sold in the European\xa0Union. The electric sales share has also been increasing, averaging one in four cars sold in Europe in the first three months of 2025. In the United\xa0Kingdom, electric cars represented 30% of cars sold in the first quarter, while in the European\xa0Union the share was less than 25%.', 'More than 360\xa0000 electric cars were sold in the United\xa0States in the first three months of 2025, around 10% more than during the same period the previous year. Total car sales grew at a similar rate, meaning the electric car sales share in the United\xa0States remained around 10%, the average across 2024.', 'Several emerging electric car markets continued to see strong growth in the first quarter of 2025. In Brazil, for example, electric car sales exceeded 30\xa0000 across the first three months of 2025, 40% more than during the same period in 2024. Sales in India grew 45% year-on-year, nearing 35\xa0000 electric car sales for the first quarter of 2025. Electric car sales in Viet\xa0Nam also approached 35\xa0000 for the first quarter – nearly four times as many as were sold during the first quarter of 2024 – leading sales across Southeast Asia to double to over 100\xa0000 between January and March 2025.', 'Electric car sales are expected to exceed 20\xa0million in 2025, representing one-quarter of total car sales', 'For the full year 2025, electric car sales are expected to increase by 25% globally, which is similar to the growth rate from the 2024. As a result, electric car sales top 20\xa0million worldwide. While sales volumes may be impacted by economic and policyuncertainties, more than one in four cars sold in 2025 is expected to be electric.', 'Building on strong sales in the first quarter of 2025, China is expected to sell over 14\xa0million electric cars across the full year – more than were sold globally in 2023. Sales of both electric and conventional cars are supported by the extension of the trade-in scheme for older vehicles. The sales share of electric cars in China is expected to reach around 60% in 2025.', 'The European Commission announced in March 2025 that OEMs would be given flexibilities in meeting the 2025 CO2targets for cars and vans. On this basis, OEMs now only need to achieve the 15% emissions reduction target (compared to the 2021 baseline) on average over 2025-2027. This announcement was made in response toauto industry claimsthat the 2025 target would be unachievable, and would thus incur significant financial penalties that would damage the already struggling European auto industry. As yet, it is unclear how different OEMs will approach meeting the 3-year average target, in terms of the degree of under-performance that could be accepted in 2025 but would then need to be compensated for in the following 2 years.', 'The new phase of the CO2targets in the European\xa0Union is expected to drive up electric car sales, although the new flexibilities mean OEMs have less of an incentive to bring lower-priced electric cars to market this year. Given that a purchase premium for electric carspersistsin Europe, the phase-out of EV purchase subsidies in some European countries could place downward pressure on sales, but there are signs to the contrary. At the end of 2024, the electric car purchase subsidy in theNetherlandscame to an end, but electric car sales in the country in the first quarter of 2025 were about 10% higher than during the same period of 2024. In Italy, direct purchase subsidies for electric cars are no longer being renewed after 2024, though the government does aim to support the domestic production of EVs. In the first three months of 2025, electric car sales in Italy were up almost 50%.', 'Over the course of the year, electric car sales are expected to reach around 4\xa0million across Europe. In line with this, the share of electric cars sales would increase several percentage points compared to 2024, to around 25%. The increase in electric car sales across Europe is boosted by the UK Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which sets the target of 28% battery electric car sales in 2025.', 'In the United\xa0States,Executive Order 14154directed the government to reconsider market interventions that favour EVs. Legislation has since been proposed that would end the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit for both cars and light commercial vehicles. In 2025, this proposal may result in consumers that have been considering buying an electric car rushing to do so before the tax credit is removed. A dampening effect on EV sales in the United\xa0States is expected only once the tax credit is repealed, and the timeline for that is uncertain. In addition,tariffsfor conventional and electric cars have also been announced, which may result in lower car sales. For the full year, electric car sales in the United\xa0States are expected grow almost 10% in 2025, with a slight increase in the electric car sales share.', 'Across the rest of the world, electric car sales are expected to grow by over 30% to around 1.8\xa0million. This would mean electric cars account for 6% of all car sales outside of the three major EV markets in 2025, up from 5% in 2024. The strong growth seen in Southeast Asia and Brazil is expected to continue, reaching sales of more than 0.5\xa0million combined in 2025.', 'As electric car sales have grown over the past decade, government spending per vehicle, in the form of purchase subsidies and tax incentives, has steadily declined – a trend that accelerated in 2022 as subsidies were phased out.', 'In 2024, government spending accounted for less than 7% of total spending on electric cars globally, compared to 20% in 2017. In absolute terms, annual government spending on electric cars has hovered around the USD\xa038\xa0billion mark since 2022. At the same time, total consumer spending on electric cars globally has grown continuously to reach USD\xa0560\xa0billion in 2024.', 'China has had the largest absolute public spending since 2020, despite its subsidy scheme coming to an end in December 2022 after 12 years. Other incentives have remained in place – notably, electric cars being exempt from the 10% purchase tax that applies to other vehicles. In 2024, China introduced a trade-in subsidy with a higher premium for the purchase of EVs. The additional expenditure to support EV purchases is estimated to be around USD\xa02.7\xa0billion for 2024.4Nevertheless, Chinese government expenditure per vehicle dropped 25% between 2022 and 2024. China has the highest share of subsidies going to PHEVs, at nearly 45%, as a result of the 10% purchase tax exemption being applied to PHEVs, which are on average more expensive than BEVs. In contrast, government incentives for PHEVs have almost disappeared from other key markets.', 'In Europe, subsidy schemes were significantly reshaped in 2023 and 2024. The most abrupt change was in Germany, where the EUR\xa04\xa0500 per-vehicle subsidy was reduced to zero as of December 2023 – which was followed by a drop in EV market share of 4 percentage points in 2024. As a result, the German government has introduced newtax benefitsfor companies buying EVs, effective from July 2024 through to 2028. Company cars account for abouttwo-thirdsof registrations in the country.', 'In the United\xa0Kingdom, all subsidies were removed at the end of 2022 but electric car sales have continued to increase, thanks in part to theVehicle Emissions Trading Schemes, which set targets for zero-emission car sales starting from 2024. In addition, the growth in EV sales was underpinned by a set of tax rebates for company cars, which represented about60%of total car registrations in 2024. When factoring in allgovernment tax incentives, an ICE car would incur more than10 timesthe company car tax of an equivalent BEV, compared to Germany where this ratio is around4.', 'Similarly, Sweden ended its subsidy programme offering up to SEK\xa060\xa0000 (Swedish kronor) (USD\xa05\xa0800) per electric car in November 2022. Absolute volumes of electric car sales in the country decreased 10% in 2024, though the country’s EV sales share fell only very slightly due to a drop in overall car sales. In several other European countries, subsidies were either reduced in absolute terms, or their conditions have become more stringent, with a faster roll-back of subsidies for PHEVs. As a result, the average subsidy per vehicle in Europe has fallen rapidly, from more than USD\xa04\xa0500 per vehicle in 2022 to around USD\xa01\xa0000 in 2024. The phase-down or interruption of subsidy schemes in Europe has had differing consequences on EV market shares at the national level, but the rapid decrease in subsidies has not been followed by an equivalent decrease in EV market share, providing an encouraging sign of market resilience.', 'In the United\xa0States, the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act expanded the number of vehicles eligible for tax credits in 2023. However, the list of vehicles eligible for the USD\xa07\xa0500 tax credit has since changed repeatedly as Internal Revenue Service guidelines have been implemented. The average tax credit in 2024 was approximately USD\xa04\xa0000 per vehicle, since not all electric cars were eligible and some were eligible for only USD\xa03\xa0750. In both 2023 and 2024, the United\xa0States had the highest per-vehicle subsidy of the three major EV markets.', 'In this report “sales” represents an estimate of the number of new vehicles hitting the roads.

We do like that rear-seat passengers get their own eight-inch touchscreen, though.', 'And those in the back are generally well-catered for in terms of space, thanks in part to a flat floor, though don’t expect it feel as spacious as a Model Y, for example. The rear seat base is quite sculpted - to the benefit of those sitting in the outer two positions - meaning the centre seat is narrow, raised and not very comfortable. It’s better than the BMW i4 back there, but the Volkswagen ID.7 is far more spacious and comfortable.', 'There’s no chance you’d get a child booster or seat into the middle of the back of the Model 3, though there are the expected ISOFIX mountings in the outer seats. The glass roof above lets plenty of light in, thankfully.', 'Those rear-seat backs split 60:40 and fold down flat for those times you need to carry something really long, but the Model 3’s boot is large by the sector standards. Tesla quotes a capacity of 594 litres including a notably large under-floor area, though the saloon-style boot opening does limit access a little in comparison to the hatchback shapes of the i4 and ID.7. An added bonus for Model 3 owners is that there’s a large 88-litre storage area under the bonnet up front as well.', 'On the subject of practicality, we dislike having to use the touchscreen to open the glovebox, but the centre console is large and spacious, plus the angled wireless charging pad works a treat.', 'There isn’t a lot inside the Performance model to set it apart from others in the lineup, though there are a few slivers of carbon-fibre trim, and the sport seats are fabulous. They’re heated, ventilated and electrically adjustable, and while their extra bolstering is designed to hold you in place during cornering, they also prove to be exceedingly comfortable over prolonged periods of time.', 'There’s a decent sound system in place as well. Hidden behind the minimalist look are 17 speakers, dual subwoofers and dual amplifiers.', 'We can’t review a Tesla and not refer to its sometimes controversial “Autopilot” technology. As standard, the Model 3 Performance features Basic Autopilot, which is effectively adaptive cruise control with some auto-steering. Next up is Enhanced Autopilot for €3,800, which adds more functionality including auto parking and a ‘summon’ feature where you can get the car to come to you from its parking space.', 'Top of the tree is the ‘Full Self-Driving Capability’ (FSD) as Tesla calls it, but buyers should be aware that it’s nothing of the sort as there is no legislation to cover such a thing in this country. It costs €7,500 and comes with the promise that “in future updates your vehicle will be able to drive itself almost anywhere with minimal driver intervention.”', '• Two electric motors for 460hp• Seamless all-wheel-drive traction• Track Mode looks like fun', 'The Tesla Model 3 is available with either a single rear motor for rear-wheel drive or dual motors for all-wheel drive. Tesla is remarkably coy about the power outputs of its electric motors, but even the entry-level car has 245hp at its disposal. The Performance model lives up to its name by using a dual-motor setup producing up to 460hp and 660Nm of torque. All that allows for an official 0-100km/h time of just 3.1 seconds, and it feels incredibly quick at all times.', 'That sprint off the line is quite uneventful other than straining your neck muscles as the all-wheel traction ensures there’s no unseemly wheel scrabble. How urgent you’d like response to your accelerator inputs can be altered from Chill to Standard to Insane. The car is more pleasant to drive in the former two settings, unless you’re on a racetrack perhaps with your foot to the floor for sizeable portions of the lap.', 'There, you’ll want to play with the Model 3 Performance’s new Track Mode. It allows customisation of the driving experience including which end of the car you’d like most of the power coming from (‘Handling Balance’); how much help you’d like from the stability control (‘Stability Assist’); whether you want to optimise lap times or being able to play on track for longer (‘Powertrain Endurance’); and how much regenerative braking you want in use. You can also select post-drive cooling so the car is ready to go back on track quicker, and set up dashcam recording of your laps onto a USB flash drive, while a lap timer and g-meter are also built into the system.', 'We didn’t have the opportunity to try all this on a circuit, and we suspect most buyers won’t either.', 'On an interesting road, however, the Model 3 Performance can be fun. The chassis has been substantially altered from that in the other versions, including beefier brakes and firmer anti-roll bars, but the biggest news is the addition of two-level adjustable damping, plus a lower ride height to lower the centre of gravity.', 'Impressively, the Performance rides quite well, even when you’ve selected the Sport setting for the damping. It’s firm, sure, but not in a bone-jarring way. It’s far softer and easier to live with than any BMW M car, for example. However, neither is it as engaging or as exciting to drive as a BMW M car.', 'The Model 3 is competent undoubtedly, and it can carry high speeds through sweeping bends if you want it to, plus the steering is pleasantly direct and the nose swiftly responds to your inputs.', 'If you can sense a “but” coming, it’s that we found body control to be lacking at times, conspiring with the reduced ride height to cause rubbing of bodywork over more severe undulations. We couldn’t quite get to the bottom of where the rubbing was, but it was certainly disconcerting, and it reduced our confidence in the car. Even allowing for the fact that the conditions may have been slightly outside what might be called “normal” driving, this is touted to be a performance car, and no Mercedes-AMG, BMW M or Audi RS model would have struggled in the same situation.', '• Range of up to 582km• Fast DC charging of up to 250kW• Excellent Supercharger network', 'If range is your top priority, there are better options in the Model 3 lineup - such as the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive variant with an official range of up to 702 kilometres. Still, the Model 3 Performance manages up to 528km, which is more than adequate.', 'One of the major advantages of any Tesla is of course access to the company’s excellent Supercharger network of fast charging stations. They’re rarely fully occupied and it’s a truly hassle-free way to recharge when on longer journeys. The Performance model can recharge at up to 250kW on DC power, and it also manages up to 11kW on three-phase AC outlets.', '• Low running costs like all electric cars• Decent warranty on electrical components• More efficient than most high-performance cars', 'All EVs are cheap to run when compared with cars powered by engines. Not only is motor tax in the lowest bracket - at just €120 a year - but servicing costs are low as there are no regular oil changes and the like required, while brake wear is reduced as the car makes use of ‘brake energy regeneration’ through the electric motors.', 'Tesla quotes 16.7kWh/100km for the Performance model, which means the cost per km of driving would be significantly lower than in any comparable high-performance car with an engine. The Model 3 comes with a heat pump as standard, designed to reduce drain on the battery during colder months when you use the cabin heating more.', 'Obviously, you’ll not achieve that official consumption figure if you’re exploring the extra performance on tap regularly, and in our time with the car we achieved an average of in and around 21kWh/100km in a cold week.', 'The Tesla Model 3 Performance’s warranty package include a basic limited warranty on most of the vehicle for four years or 80,000km, five years/100,000km on the airbag system and a decent eight years or 192,000km for the battery and electric motors, guaranteeing at least 70 per cent battery capacity for that time.', '• Tesla Model 3 Performance starts at €65,499 in Ireland• “Autopilot” options are expensive• No other EV offers as much performance-per-Euro', 'Versus a starting price of €40,984 for the entry-level Tesla Model 3, the Performance version isn’t badly priced at €65,499. Indeed, that’s only about €10,000 more than the Long Range All-Wheel Drive variant and its extra equipment warrants the premium alone, never mind the mechanical upgrades.', 'On the Tesla website, a car finance example for the Model 3 Performance indicates a monthly payment of €1,092 based on an APR of 6.9 per cent, deposit of €9,825 and a 36-month term. Hire purchase at the same APR over the same time period is €1,510 per month (with a €16,375 deposit). It’s easy to tweak the terms to your needs on the site.', 'The Tesla Model 3 Performance is a real bargain, certainly when compared to other high-performance cars. And there are few notable electric rivals with the same remit. The Volkswagen ID.7 GTX isn’t as powerful, but it justifies its higher price with a much larger cabin and really, it’s in the class above.', 'The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, meanwhile, is far more driver-focused, but it’s more expensive. And this is getting repetitive, but the BMW i4, as excellent as it is, is also costlier than the Tesla, unless you consider the far less powerful eDrive35 variant.', 'There’s a lot to like about the Model 3 Performance, especially if you’re not bothered by the antics of Tesla’s CEO and you’ve decided you like the look of the updated Model 3. It’s usefully upgraded from its predecessor; there’s no doubt about that. For those coming from traditional high-performance cars with petrol engines, its immediate pace will be appealing, but keen drivers will find it lacking in involvement and excitement beyond its g-force-creating abilities.', 'Nonetheless, the Model 3 now feels of high quality, it’s spacious, relatively efficient and undoubtedly lives up to the billing in Performance guise. If you just want the most interesting Model 3, then it certainly is that, and it manages it without going over the top in terms of appearance. It is, in short, a great-value, subtle high-performance EV. There aren’t many of those about. At any price.', 'Does the Tesla Model 3 Performance have a ‘frunk’?', 'Yes, the space under the bonnet up front is quite large, measuring in at 88 litres.', 'How many child seats fit in the back of the Tesla Model 3 Performance?', 'Only two. There are ISOFIX points only in the two outer rear seats, as is the norm, but the central position is narrow and raised, meaning it won’t be possible to fit even a slender booster there.', 'Does the Tesla Model 3 Performance have a heat pump?', 'Yes, it does. It’s standard fit across the Model 3 lineup.', 'Does the Tesla Model 3 Performance qualify for the SEAI grant?', 'No, it does not. As the list price is over €60,000, the €3,500 SEAI grant is not available to buyers of the Tesla Model 3 Performance. Likewise, VRT must be paid for in full.', 'Has the Tesla Model 3 Performance been assessed for safety by Euro NCAP?', 'At the time of writing, no version of the updated Model 3 ‘Highland’ has been assessed by Euro NCAP. It did quite well when it was first tested in 2019, but the testing regime has moved on since then.', 'Want to know more about the Tesla Model 3 Performance?', 'If there’s anything about the Tesla Model 3 Performance we’ve not covered, or you’d like help in choosing between it and other cars, you can avail of our (completely free) expert advice service via theAsk Us Anythingpage.']","data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAkGBwgHBgkIBwgKCgkLDRYPDQwMDRsUFRAWIB0iIiAdHx8kKDQsJCYxJx8fLT0tMTU3Ojo6Iys/RD84QzQ5Oj8BCgoKDQwNGg8PGjclHyU3Nzc3Ny83Nzc1LTU3Nzc3Ny04NzU1NzU4NTc3ODcuODYtLSstLS8tLTc1LTUvKzUwNf/AABEIACAAIAMBEQACEQEDEQH/xAAaAAEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAQMCBQcA/8QAKhAAAQMDAwIFBQEAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFERITIUFhFCIxUaEkUnGBsRX/xAAYAQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAEDBP/EACURAAEEAQQBBQEBAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMREhMhMVFBIzJhocGxIv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A65KeLKUBCNx1xQQ2jOMn8+2ATVOdiEHvxG3Kr8NeFc7kFvtpUr5yKHq/Czqc9fagxrynkOwXOxStPzk1Xq/ClTjr7WcSQp4OIdb23mlaXEZzg4zkH2INNjsueU435XexC00O0L3HZjd1ejttSFIbChrwc6evHJOPSuYRbl2VbrjbCbLw+gCkpavBvCoP+wrbDG7uBhHvjGKupM8ckqm1MM/F8BeW1d03ZmGLysodZU4HNhHQjjH7qESZhuShE2oGZ8joIlys7p+sduzzyFPIaeCU7efNp6ccHtRdEfcXISQH3l970fHwlMGJJtc2BIlMtKMtesLWEnGvP8p/5LS0nz+rQYOY5jjW5/qm2Is1plTVRZTW3spzl4Ek+YkD4qmCOMmiqiEMTnYnx2lNzre5Jt0hEplCUsqTpU6MpBCSAee1PNhLTa0EkZc1wPhFucyPcLbgyGVvpmDbSlYyQHcDjr5aL3B7ed7/AFCR7ZGc73+parVBW8p5yI0t1StWoittJhNkLcwRk2RurfAxNRPhmsY+0VeDektJnSgQYoCR4do49TpHNTTb0ppM6VQtMBLm6mK0HQrUFBPINHSZd0joR3dbr//Z",CompleteCar.ie,www.completecar.ie,https://www.completecar.ie › car-reviews › article › 2025...,['The 2025 Tesla Model 3 Performance'],8

In many ways, Tesla’s most affordable vehicle remains the archetype against which all other electric cars are compared. Given its strong everyday drivability, approachable starting price, and robust charging infrastructure, it’s no surprise the Model 3 is so popular—but Tesla’s appeal isn’t what it once was. Rivals to the Model 3 include the Hyundai Ioniq 6, BMW i4, and Toyota Prius.', 'Following thecomprehensive Highland updatethat was applied to the Model 3 for 2024, significant hardware changes are unlikely to occur for 2025. However, Tesla is certain to keep rolling out over-the-air software updates aimed at improving the Model 3’s features and capabilities over time.', ""There’s no denying that the updated Tesla Model 3 Highland issignificantly improved over its predecessor. It rides more comfortably, andthe cabin is quieter. There are more standard features and improved seating ergonomics. Driving range is about the same as before, but it was already quite good,albeit less than expected. Pricing doesn't change much, either, making the 2025 Model 3 seem like a great value."", 'Other appreciable aspects of the Model 3 continue, such as its user-friendly cabin layout and abundant storage capacity. However, Tesla’s peculiarities continue to complicate the Model 3 experience. There are no stalks behind the steering wheel, with those controls instead relocated to the steering wheel and infotainment touchscreen. That touchscreen contains nearly every setting and adjustment for the car, making simple tasks more complicated than they need to be. Despite continual software updates, the available self-driving software is stillin need of much more improvement.', 'Many aspects of the 2025 Model 3 show why it’s such a popular EV. Yet many of the EVs created to rival itnow outdo it in certain areas.', 'Several powertrain configurations are available for the 2025 Model 3. The base Long Range RWD model has a single rear-mounted motor that produces 257 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. InMotorTrendtesting, this Model 3 accelerated to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. Although it’s rated by the EPA at 363 miles of driving range, our real-world range testing of earlier versions of the Model 3 has yielded shorter-than-advertised results. However, the Model 3’s excellent efficiency will make it very cheap to fuel for those who can charge it at home.', 'The available Long Range AWD model has dual motors for electric all-wheel drive. Total output from these motors measures 394 hp and 377 lb-ft. With this power, the 0–60-mph time is reduced to 4.0 seconds. The Model 3 Long Range AWD is EPA-rated for 346 miles of range.', 'At a Tesla Supercharger, recharging the battery from 5 to 80 percent takes slightly more than 30 minutes. Although exclusive access to Superchargers has been a key perk for Tesla drivers, that privilege is lessening as the automaker opens its network to vehicles from other manufacturers.', 'To showcase the sporty potential of electric power, Tesla builds the Model 3 Performance. This dual-motor variant produces 510 hp and launches to 60 mph in a Tesla-claimed 2.9 seconds. Adaptive suspension, larger brakes, and aerodynamic body details further elevate the Performance’s performance. Inside, sport bucket seats are equipped, and within the touchscreen there are a variety of new settings, such as a Track model for driver-selectable motor torque split. Range falls to roughly 300 miles in EPA certification, potentially a worthwhile trade-off for the Model 3 Performance’s power.', 'In previous model years, the Model 3 has performed impressively in crash safety testing. The 2023 model received afive-star overall score from NHTSA.IIHS gave the 2024 Model 3 Good scores in each of the three crash categories evaluated.

Nearly everything is contained within that touchscreen: the gear selector, climate settings, navigation, speedometer, small adjustments, and more. Although the screen provides access to a variety of media streaming services,Apple CarPlayandAndroid Autoare not available. Built-in gaming is provided to help pass the time while charging. An 8.0-inch touchscreen for the second row mirrors many of the primary touchscreen’s functions. Two wireless charging pads are in the front row, and several USB-C ports are placed around the cabin. The Tesla mobile app works as a key for the Model 3 and grants ready access to the vehicle’s data points and settings, such as charge status or climate preconditioning. The app also allows a live view through the car’s Sentry security mode.', 'Tesla is well known for its autonomous and self-driving tech. As standard, every Model 3 comes withthe Autopilot suiteof driver assist and active safety features. Autopilot has functionality similar to many other mainstream 2025 vehicles, such as adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind-spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking, and automatic high-beams. Despite its optimistic name, Autopilot does not make the Model 3 drive itself.', 'However, the optional Full Self-Driving (FSD) software brings enhanced autonomous driving capability to the Model 3. With FSD, it’s possible to enter a destination in the navigation, press a few buttons, and have the car drive itself there, without any control input by the driver. An interior monitoring camera watches the driver to ensure they’re paying attention. Incidents ranging from sketchy to fatal with FSD have been well publicized, and in our experience the software is prone to erratic, uncouth behavior. Nevertheless, Tesla’s frequent software updates have brought gradual improvements to FSD.', 'With FSD, an automated self-parking feature is added, and it tends to work quite well. Choosing FSD also brings Actually Smart Summon, a feature that purports to let the Model 3 drive itself short distances to the driver under certain conditions. However, our experience with Actually Smart Summonindicates it’s a gimmick at best.', 'Tesla is prone to changing its vehicles’ pricing, but at time of writing the 2025 Model 3 starts at about $44,000 in Long Range RWD specification.

That was the task for Tesla who have consistently seen the Model 3 and the Model Y in the top three sold EVs in the country. The answer is this; an updated Model 3 that’s been improved and aggressively repriced: it now costs £39,990 for the entry level rear-wheel drive trim.', 'But just how good is the new Model 3 (codenamed Project Highland for those in the know) and is it still a match for the competition? After all, there are noweven more competitorsthan before.\xa0So is it any good? Keep reading for ourfull, thoroughverdict.', 'Should I buy a Tesla Model 3?It’s hard to discount the Tesla Model 3, even with the increased competition. More refined than ever, it still represents a strong choice.\xa0Keep reading for the full review.', 'Pros:Smoother, quieter, better range and still fastCons:Still no driver display, some switchgear is fiddly', 'Not so much, as this is more about evolution than revolution. Still, there are some changes obvious on the outside: the headlights are slimmer, the nose is sleeker, and they both make the face of the Model 3 a little more sophisticated and serious. It’s the same story at the rear, which benefits from new, smoked tail-lights.', 'That new styling also results in improved efficiency:\xa0The drag coefficient is now 0.219 – and with no changes to the batteries and motors, range has improved to up to 421 miles. Wind noise is also reduced by 30% according to Tesla. Other refinement-improvement changes include double-glazed acoustic glass, improved suspension bushes, seals and sound-dampening materials.', 'The footprint is relatively similar though; at 4694mm long and 2088mm wide, including door mirrors, the Model 3 is shorter than the established junior execs, such as theBMW 3-seriesandAudi A4.', 'There are numerous changes inside, too, though we’ll talk about those later.', 'Tesla currently offers the Model 3 in four flavours: rear-wheel drive, Long Range rear-wheel drive, Long Range all-wheel drive and the Performance all-wheel drive car. This review deals with everything but thePerformance model.', 'The entry-level model gets a 323-mile range, 125mph top speed and a 5.8 second 0-60mph sprint time. The Long-Range model increases that to 436-miles, with the same top speed and a quicker sprint time of 4.9 seconds. Finally, the Long Range all-wheel-drive model has a slightly reduced range of 390-miles but it’s the fastest non-Performance model with a 0-60mph time of 4.2 seconds. Top speed is the same.', 'The rear-wheel drive model uses a 57.5kWh battery, while the rest of the range use a larger 79kWh battery. Any advancements Highland gets in range from the last model are down to aero efficiency improvements.', 'As for charging? Tesla quotes 175 miles in 15 minutes for all models in this review.', 'Technology might be the Model 3’s strong suit, but it can be rewarding to drive.\xa0The body rigidity is good, and overall refinement has taken a step forward over the previous version. The suspension is well-damped and firm, and very good at absorbing road noise. A good test of this was on a concrete section of motorway near to Tesla’s new regional office in the Midlands – many cars roar disapprovingly on the rougher local roads, but the Model 3 remains acceptably peaceful, and certainly better in that regard than a Polestar 2.', 'It’s pointy too, giving it a darty agility that you’d not usually associate with a 1800kg saloon. Like many other cars you can change the weight of the steering, and we found it most enjoyable in the firmest, Track mode. Overall, it works well with the bursts of speed you’d expect from an EV – even in non-Performance trim – making this Model 3 more engaging than you’d expect.', 'You’ll quickly learn taking advantage of the Model 3’s handling isn’t the best way to eke out the range though; it drops strongly when you take too many liberties.', 'We noted a few ergonomic inconveniences. The windscreen A-pillars are noticeably thick, and the rather ugly steering wheel is chunky to hold. One quirky detail which grated was the shroud around the forward-facing camera at the top of the windscreen, which kept masking the view ahead every time we looked at the rear-view mirror.', 'Even as you approach the interior, it’s apparent this car does things differently. There is no key, rather you use an RFID card (see below) or you can access the car via your smartphone.', 'In our testing, we ended up wafting the card up and down the B-pillar to find the secret spot rather too often – and then had to repeat the process inside,\xa0on the centre console, before the car would set off. This seems a backward step from the\xa0traditional keyless fob of the Model S\xa0(but may be circumnavigated if you place your pre-configured phone in the correct cradle and owners will quickly adapt).', 'This is a roomy and minimalist cabin. The windscreen is panoramic, and the scuttle is low, meaning that the view forwards is clear and commanding, even if you don’t sit with the seat in a high position. That full-length glass sunroof makes it bright and airy inside, and the floor is flat.', 'There are no buttons on the centre console, just a pair of roller-knobs on the steering wheel, four window switches on the door and (buried on the seat) the usual electric backrest and squab adjusters. It’s uncluttered and lovely – if\xa0you like controlling everything from a touchscreen.', 'Happily, the updated 15.4-inch screen is pin-sharp, high-res and unerringly logical, with the best navigation system available. It’s brighter than before\xa0and as easy to use than ever, although you’ll need to familiarise yourself first if you want to know where everything is. And, yes, it’s still stubbornly not compatible with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto – and you won’t miss them either.', 'Below the screen you’ll find twin\xa0fixed inductive pads that allow wireless charging of your phone. However your phone just sits there staring at you which is annoying because you can see it flashing with notifications.', 'Unusually, a tall adult can fit comfortably in the rear middle seat, thanks to a cleverly sculpted centre console armrest with space for that fifth person’s feet. However, those in the back will find their heads close to the panoramic roof, and if the driver gets enthusiastic in corners, there’s a real risk of banged heads on the bulky cant rail above the window.', 'Note also the unusual, thin chromed door handles. No auto-pop-out theatrics here: you tap one end, nudging the rest of the handle out to open it manually. They open from the inside differently, too – with a simple door switch that looks just like an electric window button. Finally, there are the new wheel-mounted indicators – on the move, they work just fine and you don’t even think about them, aside perhaps from on roundabouts.', 'Quality is more than acceptable for the money, and has ramped up again in the 2024 model. It’s a step-change over the ageing Model S and we’d say that users in this price bracket will be quite comfortable with the trim and materials used, with slush-moulded, soft-feel materials deployed throughout.', 'The range starts at the £39,990 rear-wheel drive model, but for just £5000 more you get a good amount of extra range in the Long Range rear-wheel drive model. Finally, the Long-Range all-wheel drive model gets you the best blend of range and performance. Out of the three, we’d likely go for the £45,000 Long Range RWD model, which gives you just enough of everything.', 'Outside of Tesla, the Model 3 should be compared with the Polestar 2 which it trounces in both drivability and practicality. It’s hard to be the Scandinavian style of the Volvo offshoot, though.', 'Of its other rivals, the BMW i4 is a sensational electric car, the Hyundai Ioniq 6 offers bonkers design, andthe Kia EV6is an awesome all-rounder, but as an overall ownership proposition, the Model 3 has nosed ahead of the lot.\xa0And that’s before we consider the punchier pricing.', 'With the Project Highland updates, the Model 3 finds itself vying for pole position on the mid-sized EV grid. The combination of the Tesla Supercharger network, an impressive battery range, and stylish, idiosyncratic interior have been sharpened up by improved ride quality, lower noise levels, and better efficiency than before.', 'The less-than-ideal customer service reported by some owners still is an important point to consider, as trust is hard earned and easily lost. Tesla is investing massively in the UK and is building an infrastructure to support its owners better. And that will be so important as it attracts the next tranche of buyers.', 'Throw in the cheaper pricing, and Tesla has given the legacy carmakers something to think about yet again. You win, too, because as usable electric cars go, it doesn’t get much better than this.', 'Specs below are for the Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive', 'We drive the facelifted Kia EV6 and, surprise surprise,...', 'We drive the facelifted Kia EV6 and, surprise surprise,...', ""BMW's electric 4-series is a force to be reckoned with -..."", ""BMW's electric 4-series is a force to be reckoned with -..."", 'We drive Hyundai’s wacky...', 'We drive Hyundai’s wacky...', 'All you need to know about the new Tesla Model Y SUV', 'A sector-by-sector guide to the best electric cars on sale...', 'Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years.

The company’s stock has plummeted 50% from its December 2024 peak, marking nine consecutive weeks of decline. The shares, which rode a years-long wave of euphoria fuelled by Elon Musk’s visionary promises and breakneck growth, have tumbled amid a perfect storm of challenges.', 'This article will dissect the multifaceted collapse of Tesla’s stock price, exploring how the convergence of overhyped expectations, operational missteps, and market shifts have exposed the vulnerabilities beneath one of history’s most polarising market darlings.', 'For years, Tesla has soared on the wings of investor euphoria, trading at stratospheric multiples that dwarfed those of legacy automakers—a disparity that defied traditional valuation logic. As at 31 December 2024, Tesla’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio eclipsed197, a figure that starkly contrasted with the single-digit P/E ratios anchoring industry stalwarts like Toyota (10.81) or Ford (6.78). Even more audacious was Tesla’s market capitalisation, which briefly surpassed the combined value of the world’s top 10 automakers despite producing a fraction of their output.', 'Sceptics have long anticipated this correction, as most of Tesla’s US$1 trillion valuation zenith relied not on present-day fundamentals but on a mosaic of futuristic promises. Autonomous robotaxis, a self-driving ride-hailing network, humanoid Optimus robots, and AI-powered energy ecosystems were marketed as inevitabilities, not mere possibilities. Yet these ventures remain largely conceptual, with timelines slipping and regulatory hurdles mounting.', 'For instance, Tesla’s full self-driving (FSD) technology, touted as a recurring revenue ‘goldmine’, still requires human oversight after a decade of development, while robotaxis exist only as renderings and prototypes. Meanwhile, competitors like Waymo and Cruise are deploying autonomous fleets, eroding Tesla’s first-mover narrative.', 'As the market sentiment pivots from speculative growth to cash-flow pragmatism—a shift accelerated by inflationary pressures and geopolitical volatility—Tesla’s bubble has deflated rapidly, resetting its valuation to align with the gritty realities of automotive economics.', 'Tesla’s financial performance has deteriorated significantly, weakening margins and undermining investor confidence. Tesla posted a earnings miss for Q4 2024, withrevenue of US$25.7 billionfalling approximately US$1.5 billion short of projections. This underperformance has raised serious concerns about Tesla’s growth trajectory, especially as it coincides with the company’s first annual sales decline in its history during 2024.', 'Additionally, Tesla’s profit margin, excluding regulatory credits, hascontracted to 13.6%,significantly below analyst expectations of 16.2% and much narrower than in recent years. This margin compression reflects mounting competitive pressures and Tesla’s inability to maintain premium pricing in an increasingly crowded electric vehicle market. The reliance on non-operational gains is particularly concerning –US$600 millionof Tesla’s fourth-quarter profit came from increased bitcoin holdings rather than its core automotive business.', 'Tesla’s early-mover advantage in the EV market has substantially diminished as competitors have caught up. Legacy automakers like Ford and GM have leveraged their deep pockets and manufacturing expertise to develop compelling electric vehicles that directly challenge Tesla’s dominance. These established players bring decades of automotive experience and robust supply chains, allowing them to scale production efficiently and reach broad market segments.', 'Chinese manufacturer BYD has emerged as Tesla’s most formidable competitor, consistentlyoutperforming Teslain sales volume in China, the world’s largest EV market. BYD’s success is built on competitive pricing, strong government support, and products tailored to local preferences. The company’s international expansion, including apartnership with Uber to deploy 100,000 vehiclesacross multiple regions, signals its ambition to challenge Tesla globally.', 'BYD recently unveiled charging technology that candeliver up to 400 kilometres of range after just five minutes, surpassing Tesla’s quickest version, which provides 275 kilometres after 15 minutes. This advancement threatens one of Tesla’s key selling points – its supercharging network and battery technology. As competitors catch up technologically, Tesla’s differentiation in the market continues to erode.', 'Persistentquality concernsand unfulfilled promises have tarnished Tesla’s reputation. Many critics have repeatedly highlighted poor build quality in some Tesla vehicles, damaging the brand’s premium positioning. These quality issues become increasingly problematic as competition intensifies, giving consumers viable alternatives from manufacturers with longer track records of consistent quality.', 'Additionally,Tesla has a history of overpromising and under-delivering, such as missing production goals for new models and releasing products that look significantly different from initial announcements. This pattern undermines confidence in the company’s ability to execute its promises. The latest update indicates that its more affordable vehicle models are ‘on track for production to commence in thefirst half of 2025,’ while the Cybertaxi autonomous vehicle is anticipated for 2026. However, given Tesla’s track record, investors remain sceptical about these timelines.', 'The CEO’s growing political involvement has created significant controversy, potentially alienating a substantial portion of Tesla’s customer base. Tesla has experienced dramatic sales declines in markets where Musk has made controversial political statements. In Germany, where Musk’s provocative statements and perceived political alignments have raised concerns,Tesla registrations plummeted 76% in Februarycompared to the previous year.', 'Musk’s political activities havesparked protests, consumer boycotts, and even reported sabotage attacks on Tesla vehicles, charging stations, and production plants. These reactions indicate that Musk’s political positioning has alienated segments of Tesla’s traditionally progressive customer base, particularly in environmentally conscious markets where electric vehicles are most popular.', 'Investors have expressed growing concern about Musk being a ‘distracted CEO’ whose attention is divided among multiple companies and political activities. This distraction comes at a critical time when Tesla faces unprecedented competitive challenges and needs focused leadership in transitioning from a high-growth startup to a mature automaker competing in an increasingly crowded market.', 'Tesla’s stock decline represents a fundamental reassessment of the company’s prospects in light of intensifying competition, margin pressures, and leadership challenges. While the company maintains significant brand recognition and technological innovation advantages, these advantages have narrowed considerably.', 'For Tesla to regain investor confidence, it will need to simultaneously demonstrate progress on several fronts: improving production efficiency to boost margins, accelerating technological development to maintain differentiation, addressing quality concerns, and delivering on promises of more affordable vehicles.
