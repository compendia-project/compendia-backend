Honestly, the buttons on the Model 3's steering wheel were so annoying for anyone who lives in a country with a lot of roundabouts.\xa0”"", 'Tom Says', ""“I rather like the way the new Model Y looks like the Tesla Robotaxi, and that rear light is pretty cool. The interior's still a bit sparse for my tastes, and I'd love the option of a head-up display. But it's still looking like a great all-rounder.”"", 'Driven and reviewed by', 'Vicky Parrott', '\u200b', ""The Tesla Model Y. You don’t really need me to tell you about it, do you? After all, it was the best selling electric car in the UK and across the whole world, in 2024. Oh, and in 2023. And yup, you guessed it – in 2022, too. So, this new one? It's pretty big news."", ""This new 2025 Tesla Model Y isn't an all-new car; it's a facelift, so we’re talking about the same platform as the'old' Model Y, but with a sleek new look inspired by the Cybertruck and Cybercab. It’s also more aerodynamic, has a stiffer body shell to improve handling and comfort, and it’s said to be quieter and more comfortable on the move."", 'The Model Y remains much the same size, and at 4.79-metres long it’s still a rival for a huge array of other electric SUVs, ranging from premium stuff like thePorsche MacanandAudi Q6 e-tronthrough to more affordable alternatives like theFord Mustang Mach-E, BYD Sealion 7, Peugeot E-3008,Skoda Enyaq,Kia EV6,Renault Scenic E-Techand Toyota bZ4X.', 'For this 2025 Model Y, Tesla has given it a new fascia with a lower front splitter and a sleek, full-width headlight that’s a bit reminiscent of theCybertruckor Robotaxi. Or of Cyclops from X-Men, if you ask me. You get the gist – it’s all very futuristic and minimalist, and I actually rather like it. It’s also key to the improved aerodynamics that have allowed Tesla to squeeze an extra 20 miles or so out of the official range figures, making this one of the longest range electric SUVs you can buy.', ""The back of the Model Y looks cool, too. I really love the way the new light strip is hidden, and reflects onto the bodywork so that you get a sort of ‘ambient’ look to it. It's a bit different to the straightforward LED lightstrips that have become a bit ubiquitous on a lot of modern cars."", ""The Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive\xa0has an official WLTP range of 311 miles, and a 0-60mph time of 5.6 seconds. The Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive\xa0has up to 387 miles of WLTP range and a 0-60mph of 5.4 seconds, with the Long Range All-Wheel Drive\xa0offering 364 miles of range (WLTP)\xa0and a 0-60mph time of 4.6 seconds. The Performance model is almost inevitable, but details haven't yet been confirmed."", '“Tesla doesn’t state battery capacities.” So said the nice man from Tesla when I asked him about the Model Y, and I can’t say I was surprised. I’ve been asking Tesla representatives about battery specifics for a decade now, and have always had the same response. Never mind. It’s annoying, especially as the details inevitably find their way onto the internet via the ever-enthusiastic Tesla owners clubs, anyway, but it’s safe to say that the Tesla Model Y has retained its 75kWh lithium-ion NMC battery and has made range gains through aerodynamic improvements.', 'Rapid charging speeds peak at 250kW, which is nothing new for the Model Y, but still makes this one of the fastest-charging electric family cars. It’s up there with the Porsche Macan, Audi Q6 e-tron and Kia EV6 for that, and will manage a 10-80% top-up in well under 30 minutes.', 'Obviously, being a Tesla, you have access to the Tesla Supercharger network. Let’s face it - this remains a benchmark for cost and reliability when it comes to public rapid charging, and is still a big incentive for high mileage drivers.', 'Considering a used Tesla? Check out the secondhand cars for sale on Electrifying.com', 'You do lose 20-litres of space in the 2025 Tesla Model Y’s boot, as a result of the new, electrically-folding rear seats, but the boot space is still pretty huge with a total load capacity of 2,138 litres including the frunk. More than that, the rear seats now fold flat electrically and the bootlid is powered, too. There’s also a funky, magnetic loadbay cover that you can fold up and back, and that can also be stowed away in a dedicated cubby under the boot floor. Speaking as a dog owner, this sort of stuff is a lifesaver when you want to get the dog in the boot, but don’t want to leave the loadbay cover behind.', 'Up front in the cabin, there’s some big news… And it comes in the form of the indicator stalk. This is controversial, because the ‘Highlander’2024 Model 3became infamous for the indicator buttons on the steering wheel, which replaced its indicator stalk, and which many of us really didn’t get along with. Not least, our illustrious leader, Ginny(you can check out her opinion, here).', 'Tesla won’t confirm that it’s chosen to keep an indicator stalk on the Model Y because, well, there was a lot of hate for the indicator buttons on the 3. But it seems logical that that’s why the Y has a ‘precision engineered’ stalk. Anyway, regardless of why it’s there, we’re very pleased that it is.', 'The rest of the interior is improved with better material finish and ambient lighting, while the glass also reflects 26% more of the sunlight to keep the interior cool in the summer and reduce glare.', 'As ever with the Y, space isn’t a problem and even a tall adult will be alright in the back despite that swoopy roofline.', ""One last thing to know: the seven-seat Tesla Model Y that only arrived last year (after a very, very long wait)? That's not confirmed for this facelift, yet. And they've sold out of the ones that did get brought into the UK. So if you want a seven-seat Model Y, you're out of luckunless you want to buy used. And even then, there aren't many out there."", 'The 15.4-inch touchscreen stays much the same, and is still your portal to all of the car’s inner workings and functions, but obviously with Tesla’s over-the-air software updates it’ll always have the latest software. Still no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, but it’s a good system regardless.', 'Tech upgrades include improved wi-fi hotspot that’s now got greater range and faster download speeds. The phone key performance has also improved thanks to the addition of ‘ultra wideband’. Nope, I don’t know what that is, either, but it means that - if you set your phone up so that it functions as your car key for keyless entry and drive – the car will now sense your phone more reliably and from a bit further away.', ""Other improvements include redesigned seats, which are usefully comfier than the seats you got in the pre-facelift Model Y. There's more side support in the front seats, and longer seat squabs in the back, and they feel a bit softer to me. Just nicer all round, really."", 'The trademark huge panoramic glass roof is still standard, too, which makes the whole thing feel nice and airy.\xa0You also get an 8.0-inch colour screen in the back, now, which controls the climate control in the back, or you can do some gaming on it.', 'Overall, the improved materials and new ambient lighting have lifted the feel of the Model Y’s interior so that it now feels noticeably classier, even if Porsche, BMW and Audi don’t need to worry about Tesla bettering their cabin quality any time soon.', 'I spent a few days running around in the Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD (the Launch Edition, to be specific), and it is a noticeable improvement on the older Model Y. It’s still not the comfiest in terms of ride comfort; there’s noticeable thumps and jarring over patched up town roads, although it settles much better at higher speeds than the pre-facelift Model Y.', 'A new steering wheel is another improvement; it’s a bit slimmer and looks nicer, which only helps you to enjoy the fairly quick but well-weighted steering. It really does feel quite sporty, the Model Y. Not in quite the engaging, sports-SUV way that the Macan does, but it turns nicely into corners and generally feels keyed in. Just a bit sharper and more assertive than the Skoda Enyaq, really, although the Skoda’s the better bet if you want a soft, cushy ride.', 'Refinement is okay in the Tesla; again, it’s improved but it’s still not the best in class. There’s a bit of wind noise, albeit nothing that’s going to really bother you, and tyre noise is quite noticeable off the 20-inch Michelin tyres that were fitted to our test car.', 'Performance? I mean, yeah, it’s got that. The AWD Long Range manages 0-60mph in 4.6 seconds, so it’s not short of acceleration when you want it, and you can really shock your kids if you want to.', 'As with the Model 3, the Model Y only has one, heavy brake regen’ setting that means you drive around almost all of the time just using the accelerator pedal – you barely need to use the brake pedal at all, although it’s got perfectly decent feel and response when you do.', 'Generally, it’s a slick and impressive drive, the Model Y. A Kia EV6 is a bit sharper and more fun to drive (if a lot smaller inside), and the Enyaq is comfier yet misses out on the convenience and lower costs of the Tesla Supercharger network.', ""Orders are open now and deliveries begin in May this year for the 'Juniper' Tesla Model Y AWD Long Range Launch Edition, but at £60,995 it's surprisingly expensive and we'd say you're better off waiting a few weeks longer to get hold of one of the standard models."", ""The\xa0Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive starts from £48,990, while the Long Range All-Wheel Drive starting from £51,990, which is actually some £1,000 cheaper than previously! Either of these are great value, as is the-entry level Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive that starts at\xa0\xa0£44,990. Deliveries of these rather better value models are due to start in early summer 2025, so there's not too long to wait."", ""All new Model Y vehicles include front and rear lightbars, acoustic glass, an 8-inch rear touchscreen, powered boot opening, customisable ambient lighting, and an additional front facing camera. The Launch Edition does get some upgraded features including ventilated front seats, some exclusive badging and kick-plate design, but it's really not worth the extra money, if you ask me."", 'Enhanced Autopilot, which includes semi-autonomous lane-changes and motorway slip-road control (on top of the standard adaptive cruise control) is a £3,800 option on every Model Y.', ""'Full Self-Driving Capability' includes traffic light- and stop-sign recognition, and will also be updated automatically as Tesla introduces more upgrades in future. Mind you, it costs £6,800 and we can't stress enough that it is not - I repeat, NOT - an actual self-driving mode. It is probably the best and most advanced semi-autonomous driving system on sale. But even with it fitted, a Tesla will not drive itself. And it's not going to drive itself any time soon. So don't be fooled by the very misleading 'full self-driving' name. Rant over..."", 'Obviously, the final decision for most potential Model Y buyers will come down to monthly finance costs, which start from £399 for the entry level car, £449 per month for the Long Range RWD and £499 for the Long Range AWD, assuming a deposit of £6,000 and a contract of 48 months.', 'Those are some very competitive monthly deals, but if you want to grab a real bargainthen you can always check out our weekly deals page, which is updated every week with the very best electric car deals every week.', 'Overall, the new 2025 Tesla Model Y feels like more of the same – but better. We like all of the updates, including the style stuff, and the comfier seats and prospect of better ride comfort and refinement definitely sound good to us. It’s great to drive, and now more comfortable as well – which was always our main issue previously.', 'The price of the Launch Edition is, frankly, a bit too much. But the more affordable models are good value and promise impressive range, tech and practicality for the money – not to mention the ever-tempting convenience of the Supercharger network.', 'We still prefer the Skoda Enyaq’s comfier approach to life, but the Model Y remains one of the best electric family cars out there.', 'Skoda Enyaq 2025 Review', 'Polestar 4 Review', 'Audi Q6 e-tron Review', 'You currently have no cars in your showroom.Browse our reviewshereto start.', 'Please fill out your contact details below.', 'We’re here to help', 'Contact us below and a brand expert will be in touch.We’ve teamed up with one of the UK’s leading dealer groups, Marshall Motor Group, to bring you hassle-free car buying with the help of the electric experts.']","data:image/jpeg;base64,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",Electrifying.com,www.electrifying.com,https://www.electrifying.com › ... › Tesla Reviews,['2025 Tesla']

'The newest Model Y looks very different from its predecessor. Photo: HWZ', 'Is it possible to write a review of any Tesla without mentioning its CEO Elon Musk? For better or worse, the company is synonymous—symbiotic, even—with Musk. After all,profits plummeted 71%amidst Musk’s involvement with the Trump administration. But even if you disagree with his views and his activities in American politics, it’s hard not to be impressed with what Tesla has achieved and its products. The company’s Model Y wasn’t just the best-selling EV in the world, it was the best-selling car in the world. Clearly, it’s no chump.', ""The TL;DR version:As a transportation device, the new Model Y is extremely capable. It's practical, comfortable, and priced reasonably."", 'It’s easy to mistakethe new Model Yas being an entirely new model because it looks so different to the one it replaces. But it’s actually a facelift, not a brand-new model. However, as far as facelifts go, the changes are extensive. I’ve written about the updates extensively inmy first impressions piece,and my colleague has coveredthe differences between the new and old Model Y hereso I would bore you with the details, but after having spent the past weekend with the latest Model Y, I’d say the updates are largely successful.', 'The styling changes are supposed to improve aerodynamics and add attractiveness. Tesla claims the drag coefficient has been reduced by about 5%, but this is hard to prove without access to a wind tunnel. What I can say, however, is that it looks contemporary. The entire front fascia is a lot sleeker and I think many will like the new full-width light bar that serves as daytime running lights. Though light bars are all the rage now, I worry that it’ll age the car poorly in a couple of years. Only time will tell.', ""The rear lightbar casts a soft glow and looks really nice when it's dark. Photo: HWZ"", 'The interior has also been updated to match the new Model 3. Rear passengers now have a screen for climate and media controls. Kids will love that it can also be used to watch YouTube and play games. And because there’s ample legroom, the rear is generally a pleasant place to sit in.', 'The other interior highlight is themassive panoramic glass roof. It stretches across the entire length of the car and gives the interior an incredible sense of airiness. It lets a lot of light in so it’s a good thing it’s silver-coated to insulate against heat. The coating does a good enough job as long as you have the air-con running. Park the Model Y outside on a sunny day and the interior will get as hot as a sauna. In these instances, you’ll want to use the app to pre-cool the car before getting into it.', 'Rear legroom is good for a car of its size. Photo: HWZ', 'Drivers will appreciatethe return of the indicator stalk. This makes signalling so much more intuitive. There’s still no stalk for the wiper controls and high beam—you’ll need to use buttons on the steering wheel for that—and unless you spend a lot of time in a Ferrari, this will take some getting used to.', 'I know readers want me to compare the ride of the new Model Yagainst its predecessor, but the fact is it’s been nearly three years since I drove the old Model Y so I don’t think I can make a fair comparison.', 'The driver environment is as bare as ever. Note, the return of the indicator stalk. Photo: HWZ', ""What I can say, however, is that the new car rides well. Tesla said it has improved the car’s suspension and it shows.It soaks up undulations without fuss, but body movement remains well-controlled. Therefore, passengers never feel like they are in a boat on choppy waters being tossed around. Even on poorly paved roads it remains relatively composed. Not many SUVs in its price bracket can manage this trick. But it's not omnipotent, it pitches quite severely if you approach humps at an angle."", 'Another contributing factor to the new car’s improved ride comfort is the ability to reduce the strength of its regenerative braking. I’ve always felt that the default level was too strong, so this feature is a godsend. Turning it down to the new Reduced setting enables the new Model Y to feel more like a traditional car and coast whenever you take your foot off the throttle.', 'The front lightbar and headlights give the new Model Y is sleeker looking frontend. Photo: HWZ', 'Tesla claims it doesn’t affect range, but during my time with the car, I found that using it in the Reduced settingincreased power consumption by around 3kW/100km. In other words, reducing the brake regeneration could mean a range reduction of around 20%. That’s not an insignificant amount, which means the more prudent thing to do would be to acclimatise to the heavy brake regeneration—the sooner, the better. In fact, considering how imprecise the brake pedal feels, it’s arguably better to get used to the default brake regeneration to slow the car down.', 'It’s quiet too. Like the facelifted Model 3, the new Model Y gets double-glazed glass throughout and more sound-deadening materials throughout the car. Tesla claims these changesreduce cabin noise by 20%and I can believe that. The serenity within the new Model Y is remarkable, even by electric car standards.', 'The boot is huge and has a capacity of 854L. If you hold the rear seats down, it increases the capacity to a whopping 2,138L. Photo: HWZ', 'The Model Y I tested was the Rear-Wheel Drive 110. Despite being the least powerful model in the lineup, it still felt quite brisk. Power output might just be110kW (148hp), but the car has a rather sizeable 350nm of torque. Plant your foot to the carpet and you will feel that instantaneous surge of power that only EVs can deliver. Tesla claims 0 to 100km/h in 9.6 seconds, but it genuinely feels quicker. It’s only at around highway speeds that it starts to run out of breath.', 'Power consumption duringmy test drive of over 350km was 14.6kW/100km. Given that the Model Y has a battery capacity of around 60kWh, one could get around 250km of range if you wanted to keep your battery between 20% and 80% charge. For longer trips where you’d charge the battery fully, you could probably cover 400km before needing to plug it into a charger. These figures are all very decent for a car of its type.', 'The new Model Y is a sensible update and is one of the most practical cars in its class. Photo: HWZ', 'Tesla may not be making headlines for the right reasons now, but its ability to make objectively good electric cars is possibly irrefutable. And on the whole, this new Model Y is a more competent car than its predecessor. Yes, there are cheaper Chinese alternatives, but none matches the Model Y’s levels of refinement. If you buy a car solely for getting around and transporting people and things, few can do it as well as the new Model Y.', 'The new Tesla Model Y is available now in three variants and prices start atS$76,090.The table below shows the prices, road taxes, and estimated on-road prices of the three variants.', ""You can order the new Model Y on Tesla's website here.""]","data:image/png;base64,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",HardwareZone,www.hardwarezone.com.sg,https://www.hardwarezone.com.sg › Lifestyle › Cars,['Tesla 2025 Model Y RWD 110 review']
