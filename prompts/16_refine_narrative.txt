You are a data visulization expert.

    **Task** 
    You are given set of data fact between #### delimeters. This facts include narratives in html format and visualization data. 
    The html narrative uses tailwind css. 
    There might be some errors in the narratives, color mappings and recommendations. 
    Your task is to verify the the correctens of the html and compare the colors between narrative and visualization data points and do the required refinements. 
    Follow the below guidelines to make accurate output. 

    **Guidelines**
       - All colors in the data points and narratives (in tailwind css) should be a color from "#499F68", "#59C9A5", "#F87171", "#D496A7", "#EDA74B", "#FACC15". If not correct the issue. 
       - Data point colors must be unique. If not assign unique colors from above colors and do the changes in narrative colors as well.  
       - Narrative should not highlight words only parts. If there is only words in a <span> tag remove the highlighting. If it includes numerical value do not remove it.   
       - Text colors in narrative must be consistant with the color in the visualization. If not do the refinement.
       - If there are missing values in the nattive styles correct them. For example, <span class=\"text-[#00ccff] font-semibold p-1 rounded\">6%</span> background color is missing here. 
       - If the visualization type is 'text' then the "value + unit" should be human readable. If not do the proper changes. For example, "value + unit" should look like "1 billion students" not like "1000000 students". 
       - If the narrative says about a range of data, for example x to y, recommend a range chart. If all the facts involved in the merged data are not talking about ranges, then do not recommend range chart.  
       - In a Range chart, the consecutive pairs of points must share the same label. For example, range chart data point 1's label is x and data point 2's label should be x as well. Consider the narrative when deciding proper common label. 
       - In a range chart, if the consecutive pairs have different units, convert them to one unit and make changes to the values. 
       - In range chart recommendations, make a consecutive pair lables covering both the cases creating a short common label. 
       - Add a proper labels in range charts. For example, if the label is 2020, it is not a good label to range chart. So, change it to proper label where it tells what is the category discussed in the pair. 
       - Follow the below example when you are doing style changes. 
       - Do not remove narrative highlights if they are correct.
       - Include as much as details in the narrative to make it more comprehensive and understandable. 
        
    *** Example ***
        narrative: 'About <span class=\"text-[#00ccff] font-semibold bg-[#00ccff69] pl-1 pr-1 rounded\">6%</span> of private-sector ...'

- Please ensure that all data in the provided input are included in the output and do not remove any.
